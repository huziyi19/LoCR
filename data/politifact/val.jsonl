{"message": "Its Time for the Senate to Do Its Job Congressman Mike Honda  Follow 1 min read  Mar 16, 2016 -- 5 Listen Share President Obama has taken a great deal of effort to ensure that the Supreme Court will add another extremely qualified legal scholar to the bench. Chief Judge Merrick Garland has already been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court because of his long history of excellent work on the DC Circuit. The President has chosen a man with amazing credentials, a mastery of the law and a history of independent legal thought. This nation is built on a system of checks and balances: Executive, Legislative and the Courts. For us to be the best nation possible, we must have a full Supreme Court, ready to hear cases that will determine our future as a nation. Republican leadership in the Senate must adhere to a strict reading of the Constitution, advise the President on the nomination and vote on their consent to him joining the Court. It is time for us to put away politics and do our jobs. Americans should accept no less.", "title": "Its Time for the Senate to Do Its Job", "label": "real", "id": 469}
{"message": "WASHINGTON SENATORS say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets. The fear that those children who survived the massacre must feel every time they remember their teachers stacking them into closets and bathrooms, whispering that they loved them, so that love would be the last thing the students heard if the gunman found them. On Wednesday, a minority of senators gave into fear and blocked common-sense legislation that would have made it harder for criminals and people with dangerous mental illnesses to get hold of deadly firearms  a bill that could prevent future tragedies like those in Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., Blacksburg, Va., and too many communities to count. Some of the senators who voted against the background-check amendments have met with grieving parents whose children were murdered at Sandy Hook, in Newtown. Some of the senators who voted no have also looked into my eyes as I talked about my experience being shot in the head at point-blank range in suburban Tucson two years ago, and expressed sympathy for the 18 other people shot besides me, 6 of whom died. These senators have heard from their constituents  who polls show overwhelmingly favored expanding background checks. And still these senators decided to do nothing. Shame on them. I watch TV and read the papers like everyone else. We know what were going to hear: vague platitudes like tough vote and complicated issue. I was elected six times to represent southern Arizona, in the State Legislature and then in Congress. I know what a complicated issue is; I know what it feels like to take a tough vote. This was neither. These senators made their decision based on political fear and on cold calculations about the money of special interests like the National Rifle Association, which in the last election cycle spent around $25 million on contributions, lobbying and outside spending.", "title": "A Senate in the Gun Lobbys Grip - The New York Times", "label": "real", "id": 470}

{"message": "Home Leading The News Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have Leading The News Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have By Patrick Fitzgerald At least 76 senators have visited Iraq in the four years of combat, including 38 who have made the trip in the last 12 months, according to a survey by The Hill. But at least 18 senators have not traveled there at all. As debate over the war reaches a tipping point in Washington, visiting Iraq has become a rite of passage for many lawmakers looking to bolster their credibility on national security. Many lawmakers feel that making a trip is important for their credibility when they are asked to weigh in on the war. Have you been to Iraq? Graham charged. Have you ever been and talked to them? Webb, who has not made a trip to the country, replied by disparaging the congressional delegations as dog and pony shows that do not confront the reality on the ground. Webbs views may well be the exception, as many senators still make the visit. Topping the list is Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has visited Iraq 10 times. That includes three trips in the past year and makes him one of nine senators who have made at least a half-dozen trips to the country since the war started. On the other side of the aisle, neither George Voinovich (Ohio) nor Pete Domenici (N.M.)  two Senate Republicans who recently made headlines by breaking with the Bush administration and calling for a new direction in Iraq  has visited the country. But similarly critical Republicans John Warner (Va.), Olympia Snowe (Maine) and Gordon Smith (Ore.) have all made the trip more than once. James Thurber, professor of political science and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said that Iraq visits give lawmakers more credibility on the war. The more trips you go give you more authority, Thurber said. But seeing the situation and speaking with the troops on the ground can reinforce pre-existing notions about the war, Thurber said. He added that some senators have already made up their minds about whats going on before making a trip. Indeed, many of the more outspoken lawmakers on both sides of the Iraq debate are among the most traveled, and few have changed their minds after returning. Besides Reed, war critics such as Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Joseph Biden (D-Del.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.) have all made multiple trips. Levin tops that group with eight visits. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), an ardent defender of the war effort, has gone to Iraq eight times, while Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) have each made six trips. Senators of both parties have made visiting Iraq a priority. Of the 11 senators who have made more than four trips, seven are Republicans, three are Democrats and one, Lieberman, is an Independent who caucuses with Democrats. The common thread linking senators with the highest trip totals appears to be membership on either the Senate Armed Services Committee or the Foreign Relations Committee. The dozen lawmakers who have made more than three trips are all on one of these two prominent panels. At least 38 senators have visited Iraq in the past 12 months, led by Reed, Graham and McCain, who have each visited the country three times in that span. Among the 2008 presidential candidates, the numerous trips by Biden (seven) and McCain (six) lead the field, largely due to their leadership positions on relevant committees. Biden is chairman of Foreign Relations, while McCain is ranking member on Armed Services. Among the other contenders, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) each boast three trips to Iraq. Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) has made the trip twice, while Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has visited Iraq once. Who has gone, and how often 10 visits Jack Reed (D-R.I.) 9 visits John Warner (R-Va.) 8 visits James Inhofe (R-Okla.) Carl Levin (D-Mich.) 7 visits Joseph Biden (D-Del.)

{"message": "Theres another choice Gov. Gary Johnson  Follow 3 min read  Aug 5, 2016 -- 18 Listen Share When it comes to electing their next president, Americans want a candidate to vote for  not just someone to vote against. American voters want the perspective of an outsider who can bring an entrepreneurial perspective to the White House. They arent opposed to experience in governing  so long as it doesnt bring with it an addiction to crony capitalism and the fruits thereof. And they want a candidate who looks after American interests and doesnt use war to destabilize already volatile regions of the world like the Middle East. Im running for President to offer that alternative. I am a successful businessman, and grew my construction business to employ more than 1,000 workers. I was the Republican governor of the heavily Democratic state of New Mexico. I focused on good government and I got it done  just like my running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. The people of New Mexico reelected me by a comfortable margin. Ditto for Weld. Think of it this way: Im someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? Ive balanced budgets and cut taxes. Ive also spoken my mind about where the country needed to go on personal freedoms and marriage equality. In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders came to that viewpoint  a position that most Americans support  16 years later. Im also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures. And I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more likely that white to be apprehended by the police; they are three times more likely to be searched; they are arrested twice as often as whites; and they are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences. It is not surprising that there is tangible mistrust, tension and frustration between the police and African-Americans, particularly black males. We need to speak honestly about these issues in order to address them. Lets be honest. We have healing to do. One of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests. She is the very status quo. Americans want that changed. She talks about progressivism, but lines her bank accounts with speaking fees from banks and special interests. Thats what crony capitalism is all about. Americans recognize pay-to-play when they see it, and they are really, really weary of it. Having been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. Thats one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items. I did it to keep crony capitalism away from government. Another big difference between Hillary Clinton and myself is that Im for our national tradition of peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations  while being extremely skeptical of committing ourselves and our armed forces to foreign conflicts. As a Senator, she endorsed ill-advised foreign interventions. As Secretary of State, she was the architect of tragic and counter-productive policies in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. These should not be Americas wars, and we ought not be prompting regime changes that serve only to replace bad actors with even worse actors and instability that makes us less safe. Instead, our nation need the confidence that its president will be predictable, yes, but also skeptical of engaging in international shenanigans all around the world. Americans can find sanity and principle by voting Johnson/Weld in 2016.", "title": "Theres another choice", "label": "real", "id": 474}
{"message": "Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S. elections.A deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in Kentucky's Senate race thus far.The money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the $100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in U.S. history.More than any lawmaker, McConnell is the face of looseningif not, eliminatingcampaign finance regulations.For over a decade the GOP leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.In a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.\"Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnells campaign,\" Grimes said. \"Hes the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enoughour democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\"Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left's apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court's dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.\"It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,\" says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. \"She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.\"The Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \"stop special interest billionaires,\" that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.In the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year's races.Democrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky's Senate race.McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he's raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell's approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.Former FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven't always worked out for candidates.\"One reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it's not that effective in directly advancing a candidate's interest,\" he says.\"A lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let's say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We've seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.\"Grimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell's money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.The McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.\"Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,\" McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. \"The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\"The top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.Asked about Grimes' wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.\"The real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,\" he says. \"And on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.\"", "title": "Mitch McConnell, Alison Lundergan Grimes Have 'Sharp Differences' on Campaign Finance Rules", "label": "real", "id": 475}

ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs. OBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy. TAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs. A cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali. (on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy. OBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles. TAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs. Failing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency. And failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation. OBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world. TAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy. OBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy. TAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit.

So much so that I felt compelled to bring back our segment where we hold politicians, leaders, and pundits accountable for what comes out of their mouths. It's time now, again, for No Talking Points. The Trayvon Martin murder case got just about everybody talking about race, and not just specifically how it related to the case. It got some, many on the political right, wondering why the so-called liberal media wasn't talking about other problems in the black community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDY MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Let's talk about race. Let's talk about black-on-black violence. DAVID WEBB, HOST \"THE DAVID WEBB SHOW\": The outrage that I have is in the lack of really the national attention to what is an epidemic of crime in the black community committed largely by blacks. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Why aren't we talking about it? Good question. Actually, that's not a good question. We talked about it many times on this show and on CNN. It's actually a good deflection as I've said a number of times to a number of guests here on CNN and also on the radio. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: David, do not that false equivalent. That is not -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not trying to equivocate -- LEMON: But, listen, crime happens all the time and because a crime happens, it does not mean that you should shift the focus from what happened here. Let's stick to this particular point so continue and let's talk about this case. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On this case -- (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: So, that's the reason I didn't want to discuss at length crime in the African-American community or how to fix other ills that seem to be plaguing the community in general. But now that the jury has reached one that everyone must accept it's time now for some tough love on the subject. Someone on another network got the chance to go first because I couldn't go during the week. I'm only here on the weekend, so listen to this -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African- American family.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs. Nobody forces them to do that, again, it is a personal decision. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: He is right about that, too. But in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough. Because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five, and if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Here's number five. Pull up your pants. Some people, a lot of them black, gave me flak for saying that recently on \"The Wendy Williams Show.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: If you're sagging, I mean -- I think it's your self-esteem that is sagging and who you are as a person it's sagging. Young people need to be taught respect and there are rules. (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: Sagging pants, whether Justin Bieber or No-name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not OK. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoners so that they can't make a weapon. And then it evolved into which role a prisoner would have during male-on-male prison sex. The one with the really low pants is the submissive one. You get my point? Number four now is the n-word.

CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: We took this word, and we made it into poetry. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: I understand poetic license, but consider this: I hosted a special on the n-word, suggesting that black people stop using it and that entertainers stop deluding yourselves or themselves and others that you're somehow taking the word back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: By promoting the use of that word when it's not germane to the conversation, have you ever considered that you may be just perpetuating the stereotype the master intended acting like a nigger? (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: A lot of African-Americans took offense to that, too. I wonder if I gave the right advice, I really did. But confirmation came the very next day on my way home when I exited the subway in 125th Street in Harlem. This little kid in a school uniform no older than seven years old, he was crying his eyes out as he walked down the sidewalk with his mother. I'm going to be honest here, she turned to me, and she said \"I'm sick of you. You act like an old ass man, stop all that crying, nigger.\" Is that taking the word back? Think about that. Now number three. Respect where you live. Start small by not dropping trash, littering in your own communities. I've lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life, I rarely, if ever, witnessed people littering. I live in Harlem now, it's an historically black neighborhood, every single day I see adults and children dropping their trash on the ground when a garbage can is just feet away. Just being honest here. Number two, finish school. You want to break the cycle of poverty? Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money. And number one, and probably the most important, just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should. Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues. So, please, black folks, as I said if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior. Pay close attention to the hip-hop and rap culture that many of you embrace. A culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you. And it's not going to. That said, though, the political right is not off the hook.

{"message": "As expected, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, has announced that he is running for president. And we already know what his campaign will be about: faith in miracles. Some of these miracles will involve things that youre liable to read in the Bible. But if he wins the Republican nomination, his campaign will probably center on a more secular theme: the alleged economic miracle in Texas, which, its often asserted, sailed through the Great Recession almost unscathed thanks to conservative economic policies. And Mr. Perry will claim that he can restore prosperity to America by applying the same policies at a national level. So what you need to know is that the Texas miracle is a myth, and more broadly that Texan experience offers no useful lessons on how to restore national full employment. Its true that Texas entered recession a bit later than the rest of America, mainly because the states still energy-heavy economy was buoyed by high oil prices through the first half of 2008. Also, Texas was spared the worst of the housing crisis, partly because it turns out to have surprisingly strict regulation of mortgage lending.", "title": "The Texas Unmiracle - The New York Times", "label": "real", "id": 481}

{"message": "-- This is a transcript of the interview ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted with President Barack Obama on November 12, 2015 at the White House. STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Mr. President, thank you for doing this. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be here, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about ISIS to begin with. Did they bring down that Russian plane? OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility STEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility? OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right? OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage. And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports. But this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened. STEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it? OBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit. What makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have. STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it means OBAMA: with respect to ISIL.

{"message": "U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop. The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and \"fight to rein in the EPA.\" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements. In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter \"Crying over spilt milk.\" \"What do spilt milk and oil have in common?\" he wrote. \"Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPAs reasoning is that milk contains a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil. It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.\" With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim. Beth Breeding, Griffiths press secretary, said her bosss information came from the EPAs website. So we went there. Right away, we found problems with Griffiths claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a \"new ruling,\" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years. The EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of oil from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.\" The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk. So whats new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month. The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Thats the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Heres what the regulation says: \"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws. Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPAs oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell \"raw,\" or unpasteurized, milk, so the states dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards. Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk. Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms. Lets review our findings. Griffith claimed a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies. In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The \"new ruling\" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. Thats the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Sure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right. Griffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False.", "title": "Morgan Griffith says EPA treats milk spills same way as oil spills", "label": "real", "id": 486}
{"message": "Share FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.  Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trumps widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public. Thats largely because Trump himself hasnt talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didnt respond to our request for more information, and doesnt seem to have answered other media outlets requests, either. Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances hes described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones. The Facts Congress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA. Advertisement The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.) After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses. That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property. Advertisement Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools. Share this article Share The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools  you have to  and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. Theres no more gun-free zones. His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal. Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds? Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well? Advertisement Trumps answer was still devoid of specifics: Im going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. Im also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and its gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, This is incredible. This is perfect. Theres no guns in there. Im the only one thats going to have guns. You cant do it. Im going to work with the states, and if I have to, Im going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if Im allowed to do that. . . . But we cant have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, We are a gun-free zone. And then you have these crazy people out there saying, Boy, this is the most incredible thing, and thats happening. The Pinocchio Test Trump hasnt offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics arent clear yet. Trump said he would work with the states but that he would override the states if I have to. Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.

{"message": "It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47. I believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns. Advertisement It is time to close the \"Terror Gap\" in our gun laws. This morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk. The car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last. Since 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city. In the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx. The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system. Advertisement And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York. Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts. And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism. The Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives. Today, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010. That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security. That's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website --   -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences. Advertisement This legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation. And the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court. Attorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans. A December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap. To learn more and take action, please visit:   In New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day. Advertisement A key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike. That's why air passengers walk through metal detectors. That's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway. That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations. And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives.", "title": "Terror Suspects Are Buying Guns - and the FBI Can't Stop Them", "label": "real", "id": 490}
{"message": "Obama Demands Investigation into Subprime Loan Discrimination Thursday, October 18, 2007 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Amy Brundage, 202 228 5511 Asks FTC to examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high-priced loans WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras, calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination. According to recent studies, and an editorial in the New York Times, there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers. Hundreds of thousands of African American families  many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans  could potentially lose their homes in the coming years. In the letter, Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products, whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, and whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers. The text of the letter is below: October 18, 2007 The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras Federal Trade Commission 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580 Dear Commissioner Majoras: I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday's New York Times which begins: \"Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom, black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers, even after controlling for factors such as income, loan size and property location.\" (\"Subprime in Black and White,\" The New York Times, October 17, 2007) In reality, such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods. More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns. Last year, for example, the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans, minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores, loan to value ratios, and other underwriting criteria. And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high-income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans. Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue. I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination. Among other things, the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices. Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers. Some practices, such as yield-spread premiums, which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products, or prepayment penalties, which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles, appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers. With an estimated 53% of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans, and more than 60% of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties, the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of African American families  many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans  are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years. I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions: 1) Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria. 2) Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair. Specifically, whether the disclosure of yield-spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers. 3) Whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options, including those regulated by the Federal government, in predominantly minority communities even for higher-income borrowers, has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building. Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream.

{"message": "While the school choice movement can trace its lineage to the very genesis of the United States civil society, the concept of parental choice in education began to more fully mature through the work of Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman. Just one year after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, Friedman explained a plan for student school vouchers that would enhance and diversify K-12 education across the country. Friedmans plan, and much of the scholarship that it inspired, focused on the means by which all students would have access to equal and excellent educational opportunities. In 1990, the movement took a substantial step forward with the creation of the nations first publicly financed urban school choice program, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.(link to page with state choice programs) Several similar initiatives were established in the years following, utilizing both the voucher and the tax credit model, with publicly funded and supported choice programs developing in areas such as Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Cleveland and Ohio. With the development of these programs came the institution of multiple state-based and national organizations (link to allies page) whose function was the protection and expansion of school choice. In 2002, the movement earned a momentous triumph with the U.S. Supreme Courts decision on the constitutionality of the Cleveland scholarship program in the 2002 Zelman v. Simmons-Harris decision. Throughout this period of tremendous growth, it became increasingly clear that the school choice movement would need to develop a national infrastructure and vision in order to achieve sustainable success. With this in mind, scholars, allies, philanthropists and activists discussed the creation of a single, national, high capacity initiative that could lead school choice into its most exciting era. After significant research and planning, on May 17, 2004  the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education  this initiative became a reality, as the Alliance for School Choice was launched. The Alliance for School Choice is the only national policy organization devoted exclusively to promoting school choice programs that expand private sector opportunities, primarily for economically disadvantaged children. Together with its sister lobbying organization, Advocates for School Choice  and in close collaboration with state and national allies  the Alliance is devoted to assisting local efforts to implement successful and transformative school choice programs throughout the country. The Alliance for School Choice is the legacy of many years of advancing the cause of educational opportunity. Standing on the shoulders of giants such as Milton Friedman, strengthened by the pioneering work of countless allies, and empowered by the promises set forth in Brown v. Board of Education, the Alliance is committed to the work of leading school choice into a new era  one that will ultimately see the vision of educational opportunity become a reality.", "title": "School Choice FAQ", "label": "real", "id": 493}

{"message": "Expanding Opportunity  #KempForum16 Paul Ryan  Follow 5 min read  Jan 9, 2016 -- 8 Listen Share Lets get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16. I just wanted to say a few words about why were here today. And one reason why Im here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty. So I couldnt think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century. Weve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I dont think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, youre just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. Im not saying we havent made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty  that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem? It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation  or not having enough money. We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, weve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in peoples budgets: health care,child care, energy, education  with almost no coordination among them. Heres the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you dont make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits. And because weve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and youll lose a ton. So we think weve been filling holes. But weve actually been building a trap. And thats because poverty is about more than deprivation; its about isolation. There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They dont have the support they need to grow, whether its a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss. What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor. Thats why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Dont just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty. Dont measure success based on inputs. Measure the results. And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington. It is the people in our communities  the people with credibility. Theyre the ones who can break through. And Im not saying just cut money for the safety net. Id say spend the same amount of money we do now  because this isnt about saving money; its about saving lives. What Im saying is, dont minimize; customize. Take the money were spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each persons needs. And whatever you do,encourage work  because thats how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow. Theyll not only have enough money; theyll be able to make enough money to get off assistance. The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities  theyre the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines. Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, Why do you care about this? Youre Republicans. I remind them, Well, were Americans too. We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesnt determine the outcome of your life. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself. But a lot of people dont think thats true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are. And its not enough to pay your taxes and think, Government is going to take care of this. We all have to get involved. And I know its easy to get discouraged. But what Ive learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; theyre already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not theyre right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America. So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America.", "title": "Expanding Opportunity  #KempForum16", "label": "real", "id": 496}
{"message": "There he is in the photos, aflame with conviction and heady with success: class president, editor on the law review, bold young prosecutor, No. 3 man at the Justice Department, crime-fighting United States Attorney, archenemy of the Mafia, the 107th Mayor of the City of New York. Quite a run! And now, working from City Hall, Rudolph William Giuliani, 53, has become New York's one ubiquitous figure, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. He is Gotham's action hero, self-cast as the take-charge guy who is reliably among the first at every scene. By most reckonings, including those of many adversaries, Mr. Giuliani has coupled this celebrity with effective leadership. A seemingly ungovernable city now seems responsive to discipline, its crime rate in a plunge, its tourist-stocked streets palpably safer. Still, however many his accomplishments, there is something else striking about the Mayor: his temperament. He seems to believe in mayoral infallibility, at least so long as he is the Mayor. To question his righteousness is to risk his wrath.

{"message": "'); //--> E-mail | Print | Comments | Request Reprints | E-Mail Newsletters | My Yahoo! | RSS Blank Slate Is The End In Sight For Supermax? Jeffrey Ian Ross When you think about it, its really no different than any other public works project: You need prisons, you build prisons. You need better ones, you design and build better ones. When prison populations fall--well, thats a more difficult matter. How do we keep an appropriate number of prisons on line and available to house--and hopefully rehabilitate--a prison population that is in flux? Even with violent-crime rates trending downward nationwide, how do we prepare for a potential rise in the numbers of extremely violent offenders who require special facilities--like the highly touted Supermax prisons? The answer is the same as it would be for schools, shopping malls and highways: You build them based on your current and expected needs. And you hope theyll be used. In 1994, the federal government opened its first Supermax prison in Florence, Colo., dubbed the Alcatraz of the Rockies. In the years that followed, many state departments of corrections built their own. Supermax prisons, also known as Special (or Security) Handling Units or Control Handling Units, are known for their strict lockdown policies, lack of amenities and prisoner isolation techniques. Escapes from Supermaxes are so rare they're statistically inconsequential. However, as good as these prisons are at keeping our worst offenders in check, the purpose of the Supermax is in flux. Originally set up to house the most violent, hardened and escape-prone criminals, Supermaxes are instead used for leaders of criminal organizations and gangs, serial killers, persistent rule-breakers and political criminals like spies and terrorists. The Supermaxes maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Marion, Ill., and Florence, Colo., incarcerate a total of 1,710 people, including such notable criminals as \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols. In the United States alone, some 7 million people are under the control of the criminal justice system. About 2.1 million are behind bars, while another 4.9 million are on probation, parole or some other type of community correction. Only a fraction of these populations find themselves in a Supermax facility. In 1998, approximately 20,000 inmates were locked up in this type of prison, representing less than 2% of all the men and women currently incarcerated across the country. Most of the Supermaxes in the United States, such as the federal facility in Florence, are brand new or nearly so. Others are simply free-standing prisons that were retrofitted. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the per-cell cost of a Supermax is about $75,000 annually, compared to $25,000 for each cell in an ordinary state prison. You can see the problem: We have plenty of super-expensive Supermax facilities--two-thirds of the states now have them. But they were designed when crime was considered a growing problem, and now we have a remarkably lower violent-crime rate showing no real signs a turn for the worse. What to do? How do we use these pricey islands of ultimate correction? No self-respecting state director of the corrections or correctional planner will admit that the Supermax concept was a mistake. And youd be wrong to think that these prisons can be replaced by something drastically less costly. But prison experts are beginning to realize that, just like a shrinking city that finds itself with too many schools or fire departments, the Supermax model must be made more flexible in order to justify its size and budget. One solution is to house different types of prisoners. Earlier this month, Wisconsin Department of Corrections officials announced that over the past 16 years, the states Supermax facility in Boscobel--built to the tune of $47.5 million (in 1990 dollars) and with a capacity of 500 inmates--has always stood at 100 cells less than its capacity. It will now be housing maximum security prisoners--serious offenders, but a step down from the worst of the worst. The Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center, aka the Baltimore Supermax prison, opened in 1989 at a cost of $21 million (in 1989 dollars) with room for 288 inmates. Like its cousin in Wisconsin, the structure has never been at capacity. Not only does it hold the state's most dangerous prisoners, it also houses 100 or so inmates who are working their way through the federal courts, and serves as the home for Marylands ten death row convicts. Converting cells is one approach, but not the only one. Other ideas include building more regional Supermaxes, and filling them by shifting populations from other states. This would allow us to completely empty out a given Supermax, and then close it down or convert it to another use. Theres also the possibility that some elements of the Supermax model could be combined with the approaches of traditional prisons, creating a hybrid that serves a wider population. But different types of prisoners would have to be kept well away from each other--a logistical problem of no small concern. Its worth considering that the Supermax model--which includes prisoner isolation for 23 out of every 24 hours a day--may be serving as a deterrent to some violent criminals, a kind of brightly lit billboard that advertises the life of rather extreme measures they are facing. Theres no way to quantify that, but its not out of the realm of possibility. Whatever the solution or solutions to the issue of Supermax costs, its important to remember that an empty jail cell of any kind is an indicator to our society of one truth: We must be doing something right.

Protection activities focus on people detained by Iraqi authorities, including Kurdistan regional authorities. ICRC delegates visit tens of thousands of detainees throughout the country, talk to them in private, and provide the relevant authorities with confidential feedback on the detainees treatment and living conditions. The visits also enable detainees to keep in touch with their loved ones, through Red Cross Messages, distributed in cooperation with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society to families in Iraq and abroad. The ICRC, in close cooperation with the respective governments, is also following the fate of thousands of missing persons as a result of the several conflicts in the region, and provides support and expertise in forensic medicine as well as in conducting joint excavation missions. Assistance activities, which focus on remote and neglected areas prone to violence, involve helping IDPs and residents restore their livelihood, with a focus on households headed by women, supporting primary health care centres and physical rehabilitation centres through the provision of material and training of medical personal and repairing and upgrading water, sanitation, health and detention infrastructure. The ICRC also continues to promote IHL among weapon bearers and to support the Iraqi Red Crescent Society in building up its capacities in the field of First Aid and Disaster Management.

{"message": "President Barack goes one-on-one with David Gregory about passing health care reform and the current tone of the debate. Then, the Republican response with Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Plus, a political roundtable: The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson  and  Politico's Roger Simon. DAVID GREGORY: Let me ask you about another important issue facing you and your administration, and that is Afghanistan. We've now been in Afghanistan for eight years. The Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan after ten years. Are we committed to this war for an indefinite period of time? Or do you think, in your mind, is there a deadline for withdrawal? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't have a deadline for withdrawal. But I'm certainly not somebody who believes in indefinite occupations of other countries. Keep in mind what happened when I came in. We had been adrift, I think, when it came to our Afghanistan strategy. And what I said was that we are going to do a top to bottom review of what's taking place there. Not just a one time review, but we're gonna do a review before the election in Afghanistan, and then we're gonna do another review after the election. And we are gonna see how this is fitting what, I think, is our core goal. Which is to go after the folks who killed the 3,000 Americans during 9/11, and who are still plotting to kill us, al Qaeda. How do we dismantle them, disrupt them, destroy them? Now, getting our strategy right in Afghanistan and in Pakistan are both important elements of that. But that's our goal. And I want to stay focused on that. And and so, right now, what's happened is that we've had an election in Afghanistan. It did not go as smoothly as I think we would have hoped. And there are some serious issues in terms of how that how the election was conducted in some parts of the country. But we've had that election. We now finally have the 21,000 troops in place that I had already ordered to go. DAVID GREGORY: Are you skeptical about more troops? About sending more troops? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, can I just say this? I am I have to exercise skepticism anytime I send a single young man or woman in uniform into harm's way. Because I'm the one who's answerable to their parents if they don't come home. So I have to ask some very hard questions anytime I send our troops in. The question that I'm asking right now is to our military, to General McChrystal, to General Petraeus, to all our national security apparatus, is whether it's troops who are already there, or any troop request in the future, how does this advance America's national security interests? How does it make sure that al Qaeda and its extremist allies cannot attack the United States homeland, our allies, our troops who are based in Europe? That's the question that I'm constantly asking because that's the primary threat that we went there to deal with. And if if supporting the Afghan national government, and building capacity for their army, and securing certain provinces advances that strategy, then we'll move forward. But, if it doesn't, then I'm not interested in just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in Afghanistan or saving face or, in some way you know, sending a message that America is here for for the duration. I think it's important that we match strategy to resources. What I'm not also gonna do, though, is put the resource question before the strategy question. Until I'm satisfied that we've got the right strategy I'm not gonna be sending some young man or woman over there- beyond what we already have. DAVID GREGORY: On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All Star game wearing your Chicago White Sox (LAUGHTER) jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?

Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper. Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillarys signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiffs signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process. According to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers. CTN has censored the couples address and the contact information for Hillarys attorney in the respect of their privacy. At this time, the Clintons are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clintons got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard. The couples marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office.

{"message": "62.1k SHARES Share Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be. Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obamas administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move. The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administrations problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that? The funny thing, a White House official said, is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day. But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel, he went on, no one in the press would say it was her staffs fault. That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

Apollo 15 pilot Worden, 85, and Apollo 14's Mitchel also claimed to have seen UFOs while Cooper says he actually tried to chase a cluster of objects. 4 Aldrin, the second man on the moon, is reported to have said he saw an L-shaped object Credit: Getty - Contributor Buzz Aldrin gives a confused look as Donald Trump talks about space security Tests analysing their voice patterns suggested they were also telling the truth about their strange encounters.

In total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds. Pete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969.

According to reports, US Federal Grand Jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by FBI investigators and/or US Attorneys. On July 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house. The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away. As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoDs request for information about this event, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database target hit on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a probable witness against the Clinton Foundation., Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jerseyand whose inclusion in the SVRs database of potential witnesses against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a central identified and named figure in the creation of a document titled Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine for the New Jersey Department of Education. Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxisthat is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause deathand whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its emergency administration led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase itand their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission. Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a main target person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US historythat began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundationand that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Educationand who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactionsthat, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses offices throughout the United Stateswith New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schoolsand that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their EpiPen Law that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do. Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Breschwho, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPensbecame the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 millionand whose protection for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchins husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin. To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her active and knowing participation in the United States opioid crisisthat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per yearnearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharmawho, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a blind eye to their flooding of America with opioidsand as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchins home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State. This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Tennesseeand that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennesseethat was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his Stateand whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal: Purdues own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers. Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative  that long-term use of opioids didnt create addicts but instead caused pseudo addictive symptoms. The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids. Tennessees legislature was pushed by one of those advocacy groups to pass a law requiring doctors to prescribe opioids if a patient insisted. Purdue also used fake advocacy literature, such as pamphlets, videos, and social media, to convince the public that long-term use of opioids led to a higher quality of life. The firm sent doctors fake literature with similar claims but added material on how Oxycontin  Purdues financial rainmaker  was better for patients than other opioids on the market. <img src=\"  style=\"max-height:640px;max-width:360px;\"> <span style=\"margin-top:15px;rgba(42,51,6,0.7);font-size:12px;\">Credit:<a href=\"  The Event Chronicle </a></span American nurse Carole Paladino (above) identified by SVR as being probable witness against Clinton Foundation Related Coverage: <a href=\"  Clinton Body Count Series: #1.

President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now its time to take urgent action as hes announced in a shocking message to Americans. With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now. Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide. Februarys number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents, Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason hes wanting to crack down so hard on the border. During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build a great, great wall along our southern border  in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an unprecedented rate. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop, Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall wont stop it completely, hes the first to address the epidemic thats gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years. While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, its a step in the right direction and hes at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not.

And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite. It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this persons tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didnt include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn. Fact-checking largely didnt begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there dont seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets. CNN has also released a statement: The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation. But that still doesnt really verify that anything occurred. @solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston.

Even if porn was aired on CNN, its clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.

The procedure was successful, and there were no complications, the first ladys communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement. Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere, Grisham wrote.

Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018 Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning. She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974. The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady. Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyonc, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of Scandal. On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best. She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady. Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trumps husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others. I am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic, she said. I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. Melania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks. He was seated in the front row during her Be Best speech, after which he made remarks praising her commitment to helping children, and he was again second to speak, after his wife, during the Military Mothers and Spouses Ceremony on Friday in the White House East Room. Shes become a very, very popular first lady. Im reading that  They love Melania, the President said.

{"message": "Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails and Russias involvement in the Trump campaign, has said hes willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trumps effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation. Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBIs conduct during the 2016 election. Strzoks lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him. The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, No. No he wont. Well stop it. The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with specific investigative decisions, but said that comment and others implies a willingness to take official action. Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldnt be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trumps odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that theres no question that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation. Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts. Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that thats a topic, and his own integrity. Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector generals findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trumps allies from calling for Muellers immediate suspension. Why was the FBIs sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry  and  Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that well stop Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018 The highest level of bias Ive ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer. Trey Gowdy on the FBIs own, Peter Strzok.

Regardless of all the backlash, Stephanie Wilkinson has doubled down and is now claiming she does not repent what she did Friday. All this mess started when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, together with her Husband along with six other friends decided to go out to dinner this past Friday night in the Red Hen Restaurant. As Sanders along with the rest inside her celebration nibbled in what we can only surmise as mediocre crackers and cheese, the owner of the restaurant has been called to the institution where she asked Sanders to return to the terrace with her. When they got to the patio Wilkerson told her the restaurant hadcertain criteria likehonesty, and empathy, and collaboration. So she asked Sanders to depart. She agreed because Sanders is a lady. She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration. Vice noted: But despite all the backlash shes gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing. We simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one. When Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team wasa little concerned, Wilkinson told the Post. She headed to the restaurant, andwhile Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboardscalled the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone. Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant hadcertain criteria likehonesty, and compassion, and collaboration, Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped. Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called itfilthy, and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its businessbeginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp. I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, its dirty on the inside! The restaurants Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half. Piggybacking on Trumps dig on the area beingfilthy, several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staffun-American hateful bigots. Ive a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals. Saturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadnt any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling itfilthy on his Twitter page. Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurants Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half. While on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a 5-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didnt need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.

For decades there have been people that came to the United States illegally, but its only in the past year or so that it seems that people have been doing it just to spite the system. People dont mass organize like this without someone leading the charge. Currently, ahead of all other candidates, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will likely be the next President of Mexico. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO, has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan. Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention. AMLOs key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding. Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexicos plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do. Reported by 100percentfedup: Wellat least a leader of Mexico is admitting whats been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America. La Raza aka The Race is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups: GEORGE SOROSS OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty. THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador aka AMLO: (From the Daily Caller) [] And soon, very soon  after the victory of our movement  we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world, Obrador said, adding that immigrants must leave their towns and find a life in the United States. He then declared it as a human right we will defend. The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLOs faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico. From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a van full of illegals who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moores opponent Doug Jones. Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting, the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials. Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for dozens of fake votes around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak. This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore molesting a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

{"message": "The Democrats mulling a run for the White House in 2020 are facing intense pressure from liberals to campaign on abolishing the agency that enforces federal immigration laws, a proposal that was once relegated to the far-left fringe. In protesting the Trump administrations policies toward illegal immigration, liberal commentators and writers have been embracing the idea of gutting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which identifies, arrests and deports illegal immigrants inside the United States. This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it, liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted. In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obamas attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls. ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force, Fallon tweeted. Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form. Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime. These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens, Homan said Thursday on Fox News Tucker Carlson Tonight. But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist. ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist, Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. But lets not abuse the power. Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications. Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020, Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition. He added: She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization. Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- should be asked the same question. PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS UNJUST AND CRUEL The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled Its Time to Abolish ICE. The writer accused the agency of being part of an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state and called it an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- its time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism, McElwee wrote. Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaffs tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk. SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA Sessions called Californias \"open borders\" policies a radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted. It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth, he said.

Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19  False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless. Ms. McCrummens other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizonas jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.

{"message": "For Immediate Release: February 26, 2018 Statement From: Scott Gottlieb, M.D. Espaol The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this years flu  which may continue to affect Americans into April  were already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next seasons influenza vaccines. As part of this process, were striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this years influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2. As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future. These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what weve learned so far about this seasons vaccines and the steps were taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this years findings and better prepare for future flu seasons. Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2 There are a number of theories on why this seasons vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. Were taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor. While that finding isnt too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined. So why did this seasons vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain? We dont think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this seasons flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this years vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2. However, were working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this seasons vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses. Working to determine the root causes Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. Were also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune systems response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging. What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. Were also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this seasons vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings. The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future seasons vaccines should be produced. Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next seasons flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next seasons flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this years influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this years flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu. In the meantime, this flu season isnt over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctors offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. Its also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs. The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this seasons flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nations food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ###", "title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDAs ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccines", "label": "fake", "id": 532}

Grace Beahm/Pool / Reuters In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war. He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10. Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.

Three inmates have been on death row since 1993  drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade. Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his \"unique\" security arrangements. After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it. Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon. Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment\" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected.", "title": "Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison", "label": "fake", "id": 534}
