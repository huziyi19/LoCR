{"message": "''I don't regret setting bombs,'' Bill Ayers said. ''I feel we didn't do enough.'' Mr. Ayers, who spent the 1970's as a fugitive in the Weather Underground, was sitting in the kitchen of his big turn-of-the-19th-century stone house in the Hyde Park district of Chicago. The long curly locks in his Wanted poster are shorn, though he wears earrings. He still has tattooed on his neck the rainbow-and-lightning Weathermen logo that appeared on letters taking responsibility for bombings. And he still has the ebullient, ingratiating manner, the apparently intense interest in other people, that made him a charismatic figure in the radical student movement. Now he has written a book, ''Fugitive Days'' (Beacon Press, September). Mr. Ayers, who is 56, calls it a memoir, somewhat coyly perhaps, since he also says some of it is fiction. He writes that he participated in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. But Mr. Ayers also seems to want to have it both ways, taking responsibility for daring acts in his youth, then deflecting it. ''Is this, then, the truth?,'' he writes. ''Not exactly. Although it feels entirely honest to me.'' But why would someone want to read a memoir parts of which are admittedly not true? Mr. Ayers was asked. ''Obviously, the point is it's a reflection on memory,'' he answered.

{"message": "MAKING OF A CANDIDATE Obama knows his way around a ballot Some say his ability to play political hardball goes back to his first campaign 1 2 3 4 next The day after New Year's 1996, operatives for Barack Obama filed into a barren hearing room of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners. There they began the tedious process of challenging hundreds of signatures on the nominating petitions of state Sen. Alice Palmer, the longtime progressive activist from the city's South Side. And they kept challenging petitions until every one of Obama's four Democratic primary rivals was forced off the ballot. Fresh from his work as a civil rights lawyer and head of a voter registration project that expanded access to the ballot box, Obama launched his first campaign for the Illinois Senate saying he wanted to empower disenfranchised citizens. But in that initial bid for political office, Obama quickly mastered the bare-knuckle arts of Chicago electoral politics. His overwhelming legal onslaught signaled his impatience to gain office, even if that meant elbowing aside an elder stateswoman like Palmer. A close examination of Obama's first campaign clouds the image he has cultivated throughout his political career: The man now running for president on a message of giving a voice to the voiceless first entered public office not by leveling the playing field, but by clearing it. One of the candidates he eliminated, long-shot contender Gha-is Askia, now says that Obama's petition challenges belied his image as a champion of the little guy and crusader for voter rights. \"Why say you're for a new tomorrow, then do old-style Chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates?\" Askia said. \"He talks about honor and democracy, but what honor is there in getting rid of every other candidate so you can run scot-free? Why not let the people decide?\" In a recent interview, Obama granted that \"there's a legitimate argument to be made that you shouldn't create barriers to people getting on the ballot.\" But the unsparing legal tactics were justified, he said, by obvious flaws in his opponents' signature sheets. \"To my mind, we were just abiding by the rules that had been set up,\" Obama recalled. \"I gave some thought to  should people be on the ballot even if they didn't meet the requirements,\" he said. \"My conclusion was that if you couldn't run a successful petition drive, then that raised questions in terms of how effective a representative you were going to be.\" Asked whether the district's primary voters were well-served by having only one candidate, Obama smiled and said: \"I think they ended up with a very good state senator.\" Obama behind challenges 1 2 3 4 next America has been defined in part by civil rights and good government battles fought out in Chicago's 13th District, which in 1996 spanned Hyde Park mansions, South Shore bungalows and poverty-bitten precincts of Englewood.It was in this part of the city that an eager reform Democrat by the name of Abner Mikva first entered elected office in the 1950s. And here a young, brash minister named Jesse Jackson ran Operation Breadbasket, leading marchers who sought to pressure grocery chains to hire minorities.Palmer served the district in the Illinois Senate for much of the 1990s. Decades earlier, she was working as a community organizer in the area when Obama was growing up in Hawaii and Indonesia. She risked her safe seat to run for Congress and touted Obama as a suitable successor, according to news accounts and interviews.But when Palmer got clobbered in that November 1995 special congressional race, her supporters asked Obama to fold his campaign so she could easily retain her state Senate seat.Obama not only refused to step aside, he filed challenges that nullified Palmer's hastily gathered nominating petitions, forcing her to withdraw.\"I liked Alice Palmer a lot. I thought she was a good public servant,\" Obama said. \"It was very awkward. That part of it I wish had played out entirely differently.\"His choice divided veteran Chicago political activists.\"There was friction about the decision he made,\" said City Colleges of Chicago professor emeritus Timuel Black, who tried to negotiate with Obama on Palmer's behalf. \"There were deep disagreements.\"Had Palmer survived the petition challenge, Obama would have faced the daunting task of taking on an incumbent senator. Palmer's elimination marked the first of several fortuitous political moments in Obama's electoral success: He won the 2004 primary and general elections for U.S. Senate after tough challengers imploded when their messy divorce files were unsealed.

ST. PAUL, Minn. - The remarks, as prepared for delivery, of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in her address to the 2008 Republican National Convention accepting the partys vice presidential nomination. Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored to be considered for the nomination for Vice President of the United States... I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America. Story continues below  advertisement advertisement I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country. And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S. McCain. It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves. With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off. They overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve, and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better. And maybe that's because they realize there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first. Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by. He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way. Our son Track is 19. And one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country. My nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf. My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children. In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow, and Piper. And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical. That's how it is with us. Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge. And children with special needs inspire a special love. To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.

{"message": "October 19, 2007 | Check back periodically for new additions to this digest. President John Doe (10/19/07, 5:30 pm) President John H. Cox? President Dal Lamagna? These names might not sound familiar, but these guys have also reported raising money for a presidential bid this cycleand in some cases have actually collected more than (slightly) better-known candidates. Cox, a Republican described as a \"Reagan fiscal and social conservative\" on his website, has raised $586,080 this year, which is more than Alan Keyes has raised, and Cox has more cash on hand than the newcomer. Lamagna, a \"progressive activist\" who has produced three documentaries about the Iraq war, has raised $376,400, which is more than Mike Gravel raised. Both Cox and Lamagna, however, have accrued pretty significant debt. Cox is in the hole $1.1 million, almost twice more than he's brought in, and Lamagna's debt is $349,000. But because they are both funding their own campaigns, they owe the money to themselves. Other lesser-known candidates are libertarians or members of other third parties. Military Continues to Give to Paul, Obama (10/19/07, 5:30 pm) Despite his anti-war stance, or perhaps because of it, Ron Paul continues to collect more money from members of the U.S. military than any other presidential candidate, including John McCain, a Vietnam War prisoner who backs the administration's policy in Iraq. Paul brought in at least $53,670 from the uniformed services, compared to McCain's $40,000. Democrat Barack Obama, who opposed the resolution to go to Iraq from the start, is the number-two recipient with at least $45,200. This trend may exemplify growing dissatisfaction among members of the military with the administration's handling of foreign policy, especially in Iraq. Democrats have received 35 percent of the total $319,000 in contributions from uniformed service members this year. By comparison, in 2000, the last presidential race before the Iraq war began, Democrats received only 18 percent of contributions from the military. *Read a Capital Eye story from September about military giving: The Other Iraq Surge Battle of the Sexes (10/19/07, 12:45 pm) Hillary Clinton, the only woman running for president, is bringing in more money from female donors than any other candidate. But she doesn't have the largest number of female donors. That distinction belongs to Democrat Barack Obama, who has so far collected money from at least 22,045 women giving more than $200, compared to Clinton's 17,539. (Only donors who give more than $200 are itemized in campaign finance reports, so it's impossible to determine a gender breakdown for smaller donors.) Clinton is nearly tied with Democrat Dennis Kucinich in the percentage of total funds coming from womenabout 44 percent for both of them. Among Republicans, a larger number of women have given to Mitt Romney than any other candidate in the party, 8,801 donors giving a total of $12.1 million, or about 32 percent of his total. But with about 35 percent of his funds from women, dropout Sam Brownback's receipts from females make up the largest percentage of his total compared to all other GOP candidates. Hedge Funds and Private Equity Invest in Giuliani, Democrats (10/19/07, 11:15 am) As senators, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are debating legislation that would significantly increase taxes on hedge funds and private equity firms. As presidential hopefuls, the two are raking in money from the industry, while Mitt Romney, who made his fortune in private equity, is seeing a decline in contributions from them. Nearly 61 percent of the $5.7 million in donations from hedge funds and private equity firms went to Democrats during the third quarter. Although Romney brought in $597,800 during the 1st Quartermore than any other candidate from either partyhe is down to $76,350 for the 3rd Quarter and $944,275 for the year. Clinton has collected $966,300 and Obama has collected $940,000 in the last nine months. The real winner of hedge fund and private equity money seems to be Republican Rudy Giuliani. He has amassed $1.1 million from the wealthy industry so far.

{"message": "Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image  in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's  will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry  the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution  was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: \"If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.\" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a \"wolf in sheeps clothing.\" In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies. In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011. Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program. At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives. Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits. Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken. The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental. For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.", "title": "Israel should welcome Rouhani's election victory", "label": "real", "id": 7}
{"message": "Rose Garden 11:00 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Everybody, please have a seat. Sorry were running just a little bit behind, but I figured its a great day to enjoy the Rose Garden. Today, members of Congress have a simple choice to make: They can stand with the big oil companies, or they can stand with the American people. Right now, the biggest oil companies are raking in record profits - profits that go up every time folks pull up into a gas station. But on top of these record profits, oil companies are also getting billions a year -- billions a year in taxpayer subsidies - a subsidy that theyve enjoyed year after year for the last century. Think about that. Its like hitting the American people twice. Youre already paying a premium at the pump right now. And on top of that, Congress, up until this point, has thought it was a good idea to send billions of dollars more in tax dollars to the oil industry. Its not as if these companies cant stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour. And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies profits. In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits. Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because were giving them billions in tax giveaways every year. Now, I want to make clear, we all know that drilling for oil has to be a key part of our overall energy strategy. We want U.S. oil companies to be doing well. We want them to succeed. Thats why under my administration, weve opened up millions of acres of federal lands and waters to oil and gas production. Weve quadrupled the number of operating oil rigs to a record high. Weve added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. And just yesterday, we announced the next step for potential new oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic. So the fact is, were producing more oil right now than we have in eight years, and were importing less of it as well. For two years in a row, America has bought less oil from other countries than we produce here at home - for the first time in over a decade. So American oil is booming. The oil industry is doing just fine. With record profits and rising production, Im not worried about the big oil companies. With high oil prices around the world, theyve got more than enough incentive to produce even more oil. Thats why I think its time they got by without more help from taxpayers who are already having a tough enough time paying the bills and filling up their gas tank. And I think its curious that some folks in Congress, who are the first to belittle investments in new sources of energy, are the ones that are fighting the hardest to maintain these giveaways for the oil companies. Instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry thats never been more profitable, we should be using that money to double-down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising -- investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels; investments in fuel-efficient cars and trucks, and energy-efficient homes and buildings. Thats the future. Thats the only way we're going to break this cycle of high gas prices that happen year after year after year. As the economy is growing, the only time you start seeing lower gas prices is when the economy is doing badly. Thats not the kind of pattern that we want to be in. We want the economy doing well, and people to be able to afford their energy costs. And keep in mind, we cant just drill our way out of this problem. As I said, oil production here in the United States is doing very well, and it's been doing well even as gas prices are going up. Well, the reason is because we use more than 20 percent of the worlds oil but we only have 2 percent of the worlds known oil reserves. And that means we could drill every drop of American oil tomorrow but wed still have to buy oil from other countries to make up the difference. Wed still have to depend on other countries to meet our energy needs. And because its a world market, the fact that were doing more here in the United States doesnt necessarily help us because even U.S. oil companies theyre selling that oil on a worldwide market. Theyre not keeping it just for us. And that means that if theres rising demand around the world then the prices are going to up. Thats not the future that I want for America. I dont want folks like these back here and the folks in front of me to have to pay more at the pump every time that theres some unrest in the Middle East and oil speculators get nervous about whether theres going to be enough supply. I dont want our kids to be held hostage to events on the other side of the world. I want us to control our own destiny. I want us to forge our own future. And thats why, as long as Im President, America is going to pursue an all-of-the-above energy strategy, which means we will continue developing our oil and gas resources in a robust and responsible way. But it also means that were going to keep developing more advanced homegrown biofuels, the kinds that are already powering truck fleets across America. Were going to keep investing in clean energy like the wind power and solar power thats already lighting thousands of homes and creating thousands of jobs. Were going to keep manufacturing more cars and trucks to get more miles to the gallon so that you can fill up once every two weeks instead of every week. Were going to keep building more homes and businesses that waste less energy so that youre in charge of your own energy bills. Were going to do all of this by harnessing our most inexhaustible resource: American ingenuity and American imagination. Thats what we need to keep going. Thats whats at stake right now. Thats the choice that we face. And thats the choice thats facing Congress today. They can either vote to spend billions of dollars more in oil subsidies that keep us trapped in the past, or they can vote to end these taxpayer subsidies that arent needed to boost oil production so that we can invest in the future. Its that simple. And as long as Im President, Im betting on the future. And as the people Ive talked to around the country, including the people who are behind me here today, they put their faith in the future as well. Thats what we do as Americans. Thats who we are. We innovate. We discover. We seek new solutions to some of our biggest challenges. And, ultimately, because we stick with it, we succeed. And I believe that were going to do that again. Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END 11:08 A.M.

{"message": "MR. OBAMA: I said during the campaign that Iran is a country that has extraordinary people, extraordinary history and traditions, but that its actions over many years now have been unhelpful when it comes to promoting peace and prosperity both in the region and around the world; that their attacks or -- or their -- their financing of terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas, the bellicose language that they've used towards Israel, their development of a nuclear weapon or their pursuit of a nuclear weapon -- that all of those things create the possibility of destabilizing the region and are not only contrary to our interests, but I think are contrary to the interests of international peace. What I've also said is that we should take an approach with Iran that employs all of the resources at the United States' disposal, and that includes diplomacy. And so my national security team is currently reviewing our existing Iran policy, looking at areas where we can have constructive dialogue, where we can directly engage with them. And my expectation is, in the coming months, we will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table, face to face; of diplomatic overtures that will allow us to move our policy in a new direction. There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight. And it's important that even as we engage in this direct diplomacy, we are very clear about certain deep concerns that we have as a country, that Iran understands that we find the funding of terrorist organizations unacceptable, that we're clear about the fact that a nuclear Iran could set off a nuclear arms race in the region that would be profoundly destabilizing. So there are going to be a set of objectives that we have in these conversations, but I think that there's the possibility, at least, of a relationship of mutual respect and progress. And I think that if you look at how we've approached the Middle East, my designation of George Mitchell as a special envoy to help deal with the Arab-Israeli situation, some of the interviews that I've given, it indicates the degree to which we want to do things differently in the region. Now it's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently as well and recognize that even as it is has some rights as a member of the international community, with those rights come responsibilities.

Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3 McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0yes, zerofrom the League of Conservation Voters last year.10 John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

{"message": "It's not often you see someone stand up and say, \"Tax me more!\" Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, \"Stop Coddling the Super-Rich.\" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income. \"While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,\" he writes. As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent. \"If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine  most likely by a lot,\" Buffett wrote. \"To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. Its a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\" Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\" Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us. Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:  the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;  the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;  the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;  the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;  the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;  the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent. Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on. Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap. Head hurt yet? Ours, too. Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as \"carried interest\" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers. Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that \"the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,\" while middle class taxpayers \"fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.\" He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent. On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back. One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries. So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.", "title": "Warren Buffett says the super-rich pay lower tax rates than others", "label": "real", "id": 13}
{"message": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates will consider sending some 3,000 Marines to Afghanistan to thwart any spring offensive by Taliban militants, the Pentagon said on Wednesday. U.S and Dutch soldiers drive along a dusty road in a village in Baluchi pass in Uruzgan province, Afghanistan November 1, 2007. REUTERS/Goran Tomasevic This proposal is coming before the secretary this week, Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. He will take it and consider it thoroughly before approving it. Violence has surged in Afghanistan over the past two years, with the hardline Islamist Taliban fighting a guerrilla war in the south and east and carrying out high-profile suicide and car bombings across the country. For months, Gates has pressed NATO allies to provide more troops for Afghanistan. But if the Pentagon chief backs the proposal, it will show Washington has concluded it will have to provide a large share of any extra combat forces. Gates ordered a boost in U.S. forces early last year in response to the violence and the United States currently has some 27,000 troops in Afghanistan -- a record high. Around half the U.S. troops serve in a 40,000-strong NATO-led security assistance force while the rest conduct missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan troops. While NATO says it thwarted last years attempted Taliban spring offensive, overall violence is up 27 percent over a year ago and it has risen by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand, the U.S. military said last month. IN PLACE BY APRIL Morrell said most of the Marines would go to southern Afghanistan, where British, Canadian and Dutch troops have done much of the fighting. The idea is to get this in place to prevent, as we did last spring, another attempt by the Taliban to come back, he told reporters. The timing is that they would be in place by April. This is a one-time seven-month deployment. After meeting allies in Scotland last month, Gates signaled a shift away from pressing NATO nations to make politically difficult decisions to provide combat troops. He suggested the allies could help with other areas of the mission of rebuilding Afghanistan. But that shift means the United States must shoulder more of the combat burden. The commander needs additional forces there. Our allies are not in a position to provide them so we are now looking at perhaps carrying a bit of that additional load, Morrell said. U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban government in late 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks on the United States. Morrell said the plan to send the Marines would be contained in a schedule of deployment proposals presented to Gates on Friday. The plan would involve the deployment of a unit called a Marine Air Ground Task Force to fight in southern Afghanistan, and a Marine battalion to train Afghan forces. The Pentagons Joint Staff developed the plan after a request from Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, and it has the support of Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a U.S. military official said.", "title": "U.S. considers 3,000 more troops for Afghanistan", "label": "real", "id": 14}
{"message": "May 9, 2010  -- TAPPER: Good morning, and a happy Mother's Day to all the moms watching. We'll begin with a Sunday first, Attorney General Eric Holder. Welcome to \"This Week.\" HOLDER: It's good to be here. TAPPER: Well, let's start with the latest on the investigation into the failed Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad. What's the latest? HOLDER: Well, we've now developed evidence that shows that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the attack. We know that they helped facilitate it. We know that they probably helped finance it and that he was working at their direction. TAPPER: Is there any evidence that there's a cell that Shahzad was working with in the United States? Or was it just him operating from directions from Pakistan? HOLDER: All I can really say is that the investigation is ongoing and we are examining overseas connections that he might have, as well as any people he might have worked with here in the United States. But the investigation's ongoing in both those spheres. TAPPER: In the last few days, U.S. officials have met with Pakistani officials, and the message, as conveyed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on \"60 Minutes\" is this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: We want more. We expect more. We've made it very clear that if, heaven forbid, an attack like this that we can trace back to Pakistan were to have been successful, there would be very severe consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: What would those consequences be? And what more do you need the Pakistanis to be doing, the Pakistani government, beyond increased military action in North Waziristan, where the Pakistani Taliban is primarily located? HOLDER: Well, in connection with the Shahzad investigation, they had been, I think, extremely aggressive, they've been cooperative with us, and I think we have been satisfied with the work that they have done. We want to make sure that kind of cooperation continues. To the extent that it does not, we will, as Secretary Clinton indicated, take the appropriate steps. But as of now, with regard to Shahzad, I think we're satisfied with the level of cooperation we've received. TAPPER: Did the Pakistani government know about Shahzad before this happened? And did they tell the U.S. government at all anything about that? HOLDER: We don't have any indication that the Pakistani government was aware of his plans or the attack that was planned by the Pakistani Taliban. We don't have any indication of that. TAPPER: OK, Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud of the Pakistani -- Pakistani Taliban appeared in a video last month saying the time is very near when a Fedayeen, or soldiers, will attack the American states in the major cities. At the time that he issued that warning, U.S. policymakers didn't think the Pakistani Taliban had the ability to reach into the United States. They were, obviously, wrong? HOLDER: Well, I'm not sure that we didn't think they had that ability. We didn't think that necessarily was their aim. We certainly have seen with the Shahzad incident that they have not only the aim, but the capability of doing that. And that's why they have taken on, I think, a new significance in our anti-terror fight. TAPPER: Shahzad was on a Treasury Department watch list since the late 1990s for bringing large sums of cash into this country. He was taken off that watch list. Did the U.S. government drop the ball? HOLDER: No, I don't think so. I think we have done a good job in monitoring those people who we need to identify as potential threats to the, you know, government, and I think one has to understand that in connection with the -- the resolution of this plot, American law enforcement I think was very successful. TAPPER: More than 200,000 people from the U.S. traveled to Pakistan last year. How on Earth do you keep track of which ones intend to do us harm? HOLDER: It is a difficult job. We have to try to use the various intelligence sources that we have, try to look for telltale signs for who we should be concerned about. The vast majority of people who go to Pakistan and come from Pakistan to the United States are well intentioned. They have relatives. They have cultural ties to both countries. So we have to really try to focus and make sure that our attention is directed at those people who would do our nation harm. TAPPER: There have been reports that others arrested this year in terrorist plots in the United States had traveled to Pakistan. Are there any ties with Shahzad? HOLDER: Well, the investigation's ongoing. And we're looking at a variety of things to try to make sure that we hold everybody accountable who was responsible for this attempted attack. I think the investigation is proceeding at a good pace. We have developed, I think, a good amount of information in a relatively short period of time, but we will be continuing to work on it. TAPPER: There was a time when the FBI and law enforcement lost track of Shahzad after the attempted incident, before he got on the plane. What happened? HOLDER: Well, we lost contact with him for just a bit of time, but I think what people have to understand is that we had a layered approach so that at the end of the day I think we were always confident that he would be picked up, and the question was only where he would be picked up and when he would be picked up. A surveillance was conducted, but we wanted to have him at a fairly good distance so that we could observe him and see if he would make contact with other people who were connected to the plot. Contact was lost for a relatively short period of time. TAPPER: How long? An hour? HOLDER: Oh, I don't know, about an hour, so maybe something along those lines. But what was key and what ultimately proved to be successful was this layered approach. He was caught before he was able to leave the country. TAPPER: But he almost got out, right? I mean, we got lucky in a few ways. First of all, let's be honest: The reason that we avoided a horrible incident is because he was apparently an incompetent bomb- maker, right? HOLDER: Well, there certainly was a bit of that, but I think also one has to look at the overall operation. He was stopped before he was able to leave the country because of a notification that the FBI made to put him on the no-fly list. We also had vigilant citizens who looked at that vehicle that he left and saw the smoke coming out and notified the appropriate authorities. This was, in some ways, I think, a good example of what an aroused American populace, coupled with a vigilant law enforcement community, can actually do. TAPPER: Critics say that he should not have been -- some critics say he should not have been his Miranda rights, the right to remain silent, et cetera. Now, I know that the public safety exception was invoked, so before he was read his rights, he was interrogated. But does the current Miranda system, which was created before I was born and was updated, this public safety exception, in 1984 -- so none of the crafters were really aware of this plot, this threat that we face today.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Holder and Giuliani", "label": "real", "id": 15}
{"message": "WASHINGTON  During the 2008 presidential campaign, candidates Barack Obama and John McCain fought vigorously over who would be toughest on congressional earmarks. \"We need earmark reform,\" Obama said in September during a presidential debate in Oxford, Miss. \"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.\" President Barack Obama should prepare to carve out a lot of free time and keep the coffee hot this week as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice. The bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks  loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress  were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees. So while Obama and McCain were slamming earmarks on the campaign trail, House and Senate members  Democrats and Republicans  were slapping them into spending bills. \"It will be a little embarrassing for the president if he signs a bill with that many earmarks on it,\" said Stan Collender, a veteran Washington budget analyst. \"He'll say they're left over from the Bush years, and he as to say that next year the bill will be clean.\" Experts agree that most earmarks are legitimate. Cary Leahey, senior economist with Decision Economics in New York, said the nation's economic crisis is a contributing factor to the plethora of earmarks. Lawmakers can argue that for a relatively small price they've helped boost the economy. \"One congressman's earmark is another legislative way to fix a serious problem in his district,\" Leahey said. Kenneth Thomas, a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business, agrees. \"I generally believe that the priority is getting money into the system sooner rather than later, especially if it's for projects that will use local contractors and create jobs,\" he said. Still, it wasn't supposed to be this way. Earmarks have come under fire because of those that seem to provide what Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, calls \"laugh lines,\" such as Alaska's \"Bridge to Nowhere\" or North Dakota's Lawrence Welk Museum. Obama pledged to take a hard hand on earmarks and warned lawmakers in a Feb. 3 letter from Budget Director Peter Orszag not to decorate the recently signed $787.2 billion stimulus bill with them. Democrats declared the bill earmark-free. Republicans disagreed. \"While this bill does not include traditional earmarks, we should all understand that there are earmarks in this bill,\" said Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. \"There is $850 million ... to bail out Amtrak, a $75 million earmark for the Smithsonian, a $1 billion earmark for the 2010 census.\" Democrats have been trying to revamp the earmark process for about two years. In 2007, they instituted a system that required members to explain the contents of each earmark, as well as a justification for why it was included in the legislation that way. They claimed this led to a reduction in earmarks by as much as 43 percent. But critics contended the system still had problems. Simply making information more available, they said, didn't address the major criticism: That such projects should go through the regular legislative process, subject to detailed hearings and bipartisan votes. Not only does this mean the public has no chance to challenge questionable spending, but too often powerful interests who know how to work the system get favorite measures inserted. For instance, Congressional Quarterly reported recently that more than 100 House members got earmarks for clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm with close ties to Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., who heads the powerful defense spending subcommittee. The CQ Politics analysis said that in the 2009 defense spending bill, which Congress approved last year, PMA clients got about $300 million. The CQ study came after reports that the FBI is investigating the possibility of illegal campaign contributions by PMA to Murtha and other lawmakers. A Murtha spokesman said earlier this month that the FBI probe has nothing to do with Murtha. A PMA spokesman declined to comment on the probe. Appropriations committee chairmen say they are on track to reform the earmark process beginning in fiscal 2010 by requiring members to make public their requests early, so the public can scrutinize them and presumably contact lawmakers. The change, though, doesn't apply to the 2009 funding that Congress will consider next week. Several experts believe that dramatically reducing the number of earmarks, while a laudable goal, is almost impossible. But others contend that earmarks aren't that big of a problem. \"Earmarks get more attention than they deserve,\" said MacGuineas. \"The problem is that they cause a loss of confidence in the whole budget process.\" ON THE WEB: CQ list of House members who got PMA Group earmarks MORE FROM MCCLATCHY Stimulus will flow rapidly to some projects, trickle to others President Obama warns mayors not to 'waste' stimulus money Nationalizing troubled banks may be the only answer", "title": "Earmark reform? 2009 spending bill contains 9,000 of them", "label": "real", "id": 16}

{"message": "Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m. Asked about fair pay for women during the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama was quick to bring up the first piece of legislation he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Audience member Katherine Fenton asked Obama, \"In what new ways to you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?\" Obama talked about being raised by a single mom who put herself through school and of his grandmother, who worked her way up from a bank secretary to a vice president but \"hit the glass ceiling.\" \"She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career. She didn't complain. That's not what you did in that generation,\" he said at the debate at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012. \"And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lilly Ledbetter bill.\" Romney responded by saying at one point he had more women in senior leadership positions than any other governor and that he wanted to help more women find jobs. Obama jumped in, saying, \"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Gov. Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, I'll get back to you. And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.\" Did Romney and his campaign really refuse to say whether he supported the law? Sort of. The law, which Obama signed on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims but received little Republican support in Congress. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire  and  Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate  making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay. What did Romney have to say about it? For a previous fact-check in May, the Obama campaign directed us to a couple media reports. In an April 2012 conference call covered by a Washington Post blogger, a Huffington Post reporter asked an unnamed Romney adviser whether Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The adviser responded, \"Sam (Stein), well get back to you on that.\" Later, Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul clarified in an email, \"He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law.\" The second piece the Obama campaign showed us was a Romney interview by Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Sawyer asked Romney, \" If you were president  you had been president  would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?\" Romneys response: Romney: \"It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago \" Sawyer: \"But would you have signed it?\" Romney: \"... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and  and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to.\" Here, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill into law. But he also said he has \"no intention of changing that law.\" Our ruling Obama said that when asked whether he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act into law, Romney's campaign said, \"I'll get back to you.\" His point was that the campaign was dodging the question. Indeed, a Romney adviser did say earlier this year that he would \"get back\" to a reporter about whether he supported the Lilly Ledbetter Act. A spokeswoman then said he would not change it, and Romney later said he \"certainly support(s) equal pay for women,\" and has \"no intention of changing that law.\" So Obama is correct about the initial statement, but Romney later clarified by saying he wouldn't change the law. We rate Obama's claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it \"impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay.\" In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.", "title": "Obama: Mitt Romney refused to say whether he supports Lilly Ledbetter Act", "label": "real", "id": 18}
{"message": "A day after the Senate adjourned for Easter recess President Obama said he was going to appoint 15 of his nominees during the break, depriving the Senate the opportunity to vet and vote on any of them. Circumventing constitutional Senate vetting is dangerous because President Obamas track record in vetting nominees and other high-level appointees has been very poor. At least 10 of them have already resigned or withdrawn in disgrace. Just yesterday, Maj. Gen. Robert A. Harding withdrew his nomination to become the director of the Transportation Security Administration after it was discovered he claimed service disabled veteran status for sleep apnea. President Obamas first nominee for that position, Erroll Southers, withdrew after refusing to respond to requests relating to false testimony he gave to Congress and his censure by the FBI for improperly accessing files. Many of the people President Obama is granting recess appointments will hold high level positions that will greatly influence job creation in this country. One of them, Craig Becker, is a former super lawyer for the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union. Becker supports union-friendly, job-killing card check legislation to eliminate the secret ballot requirement to organize a workplace. Now, President Obama is installing him into a position to do it administratively, as Mr. Becker has advocated doing in the past. This is being done over the will of the Senate. On February 9, on a bipartisan vote the Senate rejected Beckers nomination to the 5-member National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Democrat Senator Ben Nelson (D-Nebraska) said at the time that Mr. Becker, \"would take an aggressive personal agenda to the NLRB, and that he would pursue a personal agenda there.\" Moreover, all 41 Republican senators wrote President Obama a letter earlier this week asking him not to overturn this vote and give Becker a recess appointment. Yet, President Obama is ramming his card check czar through the Senate, just like he did with health care earlier this month. There are many unanswered questions and concerns about the other 14 nominees as well. Thats why its critical that the Senate have the opportunity to vet and vote on nominees. Below is the Top 10 list of President Obamas nominees and appointees who have resigned in disgrace. 1. Obamas nominee to chair the National Intelligence Council, Chas Freeman, withdrew over questions about payments from the Saudi Arabian government, business ties to the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp., and negative statements he made about U.S. support for Israel. After he resigned he issued a combative public statement blaming the Israel lobby for character assassination. 2. White House Green Jobs czar Van Jones resigned after he it was discovered he signed a statement in support of a 9/11 Truther group. 3. Former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-South Dakota) withdrew his nomination to become Health and Human Services Secretary after it was discovered he failed to properly pay his taxes. 4. Nancy Killefer, Obamas nominee to serve as the governments chief performance officer, withdrew due to tax problems. 5. Governor Bill Richardson (D-New Mexico) withdrew his nomination to become Commerce Secretary because of an ongoing investigation into whether he doled out government contracts in exchange for campaign money. 6. White House Social Secretary Desiree Rogers resigned after posing for photos at a White House dinner that a couple crashed through security to attend. 7. Jonathan Z. Cannon, nominated to serve as deputy director at the Environmental Protection Administration, withdrew over questions about a defunct non-profit, Americas Clean Water Foundation, where he served as a board member. In 2007, EPA auditors accused the non-profit of mismanaging $25 million in taxpayer funding. 8. Jide Zeitlin, Obamas nominee to serve as U.S ambassador to the United Nations for management and reform withdrew his name while being accused of identify fraud and improper business practices. 9. Erroll Southers, Obamas nominee to serve as director of the Travel Security Administration, withdrew after refusing to answer questions about collective bargaining and false testimony he presented to Congress. 10. Maj. Gen. Robert A. Harding, Obamas second nominee to service as director of the Travel Security Administration, withdrew his name after it was discovered he received service disabled veteran status for sleep apnea.", "title": "United States Senator Jim DeMint", "label": "real", "id": 19}
{"message": "November 21, 2010  -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR (voice-over): Welcome to viewers here and around the world. I'm Christiane Amanpour. And at the top of the news this week: nuclear secret, a report of a major advance in North Korea's nuclear program. What new threat does it pose? And how will it impact the president's disarmament agenda and his push to get the Senate to ratify his START nuclear treaty? OBAMA: This is not about politics. It's about national security. AMANPOUR: This morning, the nation's top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. Plus, the escalating war in Afghanistan. His views on night raids, relations with President Karzai, and deadlines for U.S. withdrawal. Then, hot zone. As Haiti reels from a cholera outbreak, we ask, what happened to the global pledge to rebuild the nation? And G.M.'s new start. Was the bailout good for America after all? Analysis on our roundtable with George Will, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, and former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Plus, the Sunday funnies. LETTERMAN: The Capitol Hill Christmas tree arrives this week. And as soon as it gets to Washington, it will die in committee. Did you know that? (END VIDEO CLIP) ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC's \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. AMANPOUR: Hello again. And with reports of a new nuclear facility in North Korea and a new deadline in the Afghanistan war, there's a lot to discuss with our guest, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen. President Obama returned late last night from the NATO summit in Lisbon where the United States and its allies are now talking about another deadline, the end of 2014 to hand over combat operations to Afghan forces. To make that happen, American and NATO forces are escalating the war right now, and so we start with a powerful report from ABC's Mike Boettcher in Afghanistan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOETTCHER (voice-over): When Lieutenant Colonel Steve Lutsky last saw 10-year-old Sadekela (ph), he was bleeding to death on the side of a road. LUTSKY: His mom was yelling out that, \"My son is dead. My son is dead.\" BOETTCHER: Now he is recovering at a U.S. military hospital. The lives of the American officer and the Afghan boy intersected on this stretch of highway in Khost province, when a car bomber trying to kill Lutsky and his men attacked their column. (on-screen): The American convoy was traveling this direction. The other way, civilian vehicles. They slowed down when the convoy passed. So did a suicide bomber. And inside his car, he had 600 pounds of high explosives. (voice-over): The soldiers were not hurt, but the explosion killed one child and injured three others, including Sadekela (ph). Now angry at the Taliban, Sadekela's (ph) family is grateful to the Americans for saving his life, a small but important victory in a war where not killing civilians is more important than killing the enemy. TOWNSEND: It buys us credit, in the sense that there's a little more respect for us and there's a little more trust for us. BOETTCHER: America's top officers tell Afghans that it's the Taliban who are killing civilians, a message undermined by President Karzai's claims that U.S. special operations night raids are killing innocent people. (UNKNOWN): Nine out of 10 civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban. BOETTCHER: At a district center in eastern Afghanistan, not everyone is convinced by that argument. During a visit by the 101st Airborne's deputy commander in Afghanistan, Steve Townsend (ph), a village elder asserted that the Americans were killing more Afghans than the Soviets did a quarter century ago. Townsend pushed back hard. (UNKNOWN): Look in my eyes right now. You know I'm telling the truth. BOETTCHER: But as the words fly, so do bombs and bullets. Combat Outpost Firra (ph), situated on the Pakistan border, is often attacked. During one assault, 18 insurgents died, but soldiers know this: You can't kill your way out of Afghanistan. (UNKNOWN): They can reconstitute faster than we can. We're so close to Pakistan that they just come right across the border. BOETTCHER: So rather than enemy body counts, real success here is measured in how quickly Afghan feet can fill American-made boots. If the war is to end, Afghan soldiers will have to end it. (UNKNOWN): We have to make a difference. Coming here and -- and just running around and killing the enemy and then leaving and looking back and saying, \"I didn't make a difference, I didn't make a change,\" will cause us to never leave. BOETTCHER: Steve Lutsky's son is the same age as young Sadekela (ph), 10. The colonel wants only one thing to come from his service here: confidence that his own son someday will not be fighting his father's war. For \"This Week,\" Mike Boettcher, ABC News, Forward Operating Base Clark, Afghanistan. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR: And joining me now is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen. Welcome to \"This Week.\" MULLEN: Good morning. AMANPOUR: And we will discuss, of course, Afghanistan, but let me get to the breaking news this morning, the report by the New York Times of the discovery of a new nuclear facility in North Korea. How much of a threat is that to the United States, to the world? MULLEN: Well, this validates a long-standing concern that we've had with respect to North Korea and -- and its enrichment of uranium. It also continues to validate a country that is led by a dictator who is constantly -- who constantly desires to destabilize the region. And he's done that again, certainly, with this capability, as well.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Adm. Mike Mullen", "label": "real", "id": 20}

{"message": "Updated: ASPEN  Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention. They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music. And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day  one of three he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog. Thats what I relish and thats what I like, he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is about the size of Senator Obamas foreign-policy team. Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week. Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russias president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War. My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War, Mr. McCain said. This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, I have to be against the tax increases, as you know, and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, its closer to $5 a gallon. At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his maverick stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor? In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the Christian right. Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bushs tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war. As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a traitor, Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response. He said he himself had been called disloyal by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldnt work. He said he had been declared dead, but he was reminded of Chairman Maos saying that its always darkest before its totally black. But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded. He added: I think hes wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party, he said, to sustained applause. He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, we passed up an opportunity to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service. He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldnt work. The kind of war theyre fighting requires long-term commitment, he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it. On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBAs Dancing Queen was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatras Ive Got You Under My Skin. He said that if hes lacking in anything, it is an appreciation for music and art and the other great things in life, partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly. Everybody says, I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.How come everybody goes to Mamma Mia!? he said. Everybody goes! Theyve been selling out for years. After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development. I appreciate art, he declared. If theres one thing Im going to do and I have the opportunity, its to take a class in art. He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, but some of the things werent there that I would like to see. He then added, But I make no excuses for my taste in music.", "title": "McCain in Colorado", "label": "real", "id": 22}
{"message": "Romney makes pitch, hoping to close deal Photo by Matt McClain Mitt Romney offered a pragmatic view of the tight Republican race for president Friday at a Denver car dealership, saying that some states are \"long shots\" for him while others are there for the taking. Colorado, he believed, fell into the latter category - which is why he made the stop in Denver on his way to Utah to attend funeral services for Gordon B. Hinckley. Hinckley, 97, was president of the Mormon church, of which Romney is a member. Romney, standing in the parking lot of Freeway Ford, stood with his sleeves rolled up, despite the rapidly dropping temperature, and offered a broad view of Super Tuesday's contest featuring 21 states, including Colorado, holding Republican caucuses or primaries. \"At this stage, I expect to keep on battling and get the nomination,\" he said. \"I'm not going to forecast anything but success.\" The campaign is targeting a series of states in the next few days that Romney could play well in. After Utah, where he enjoys strong support, the former Massachusetts governor will head to Minnesota. His campaign didn't rule out another trip to Colorado before Tuesday. The state has seen massive campaign activity this week as Super Tuesday nears, with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drawing about 13,000 people at the University of Denver and former President Bill Clinton, stumping for his wife Sen. Hillary Clinton, bringing in about 4,500 at the same location. Dealership cites 'civic duty' Romney's event drew about 1,200 supporters, who were shoehorned into the car dealership showroom. It was a last-minute change of venue. The campaign had planned to host the rally at the Harley Davidson dealership in Thornton, but contacted Freeway Ford General Manager and Vice President Mike Peebles to see if they could have the event there after the motorcycle dealership's owner pulled the plug on the event. Peebles, who said that the business had not hosted a presidential candidate's visit before, agreed and soon had the place crawling with supporters, Secret Service and media - forcing salespeople from their cubicles and moving cars around to accommodate everyone. \"We're not endorsing him or anything,\" Peebles said. \"We just thought it would be a good thing to help out. Doing our civic duty, right?\" Romney spoke to the crowd for about 20 minutes, offering up his usual talking points about strengthening the economy, adding 100,000 troops to the military, and his experience as a businessman and governor. Romney, whose wealth has been estimated at $250 million, spent years as an investor and venture capitalist. One area where he didn't spend much time talking was on Western issues, including things such as natural resources. The economy was where he took his shot at his chief rival, Sen. John McCain - a name that elicited a chorus of boos. \"He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,\" Romney said. \"Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.\" Warnings about economy It was the only real slap at the McCain campaign, which did not return repeated calls for comment. Romney has been making his hay with the economy. He openly worried about the direction the nation is headed in and suggested that it could be headed for a dip in status amid emerging global economies. \"Unless we get ourselves on the right track, this country could become a second-tier nation,\" he said. It was a key part of Romney's theme. A poster behind him read \"Washington is broken.\" He cited his experience as a governor in a liberal state as proof that he could work with the opposition party and get things accomplished. Beauprez said that an ability to unify the country is needed and conceded that President Bush has had \"a bunker mentality\" that he believes Romney would not have if elected. Democrats offered a less rosy view. \"Mitt can't hide the fact that a vote for Romney is a vote for a third Bush term,\" said Damien LaVera, Democratic National Committee spokesman. Still, the crowd cheered at several points. Afterward, Romney waded through the crowd and signed T-shirts and posed for pictures. Recently, Romney has been casting himself as the choice of the conservative wing of the party by talking about illegal immigration and family values. The tactic has won some over, but he has not been able to secure an endorsement from Focus on the Family founder James Dobson. Dobson has said, speaking as a private citizen since the Colorado Springs-based group does not endorse candidates, that he would not support McCain.", "title": "Romney makes pitch, hoping to close deal : Elections : The Rocky Mountain News", "label": "real", "id": 23}
{"message": "Transcript below: MIKA BRZEZINSKI: With us now Republican Representative from Indiana and Chairman of the House Republican Conference, Congressman Mike Pence. He's also Chairman of the American Energy Solutions Group which will introduce the House GOP's answer to the nation's energy problem in a bill later today. Morning Joe has an exclusive look at the details. JOE SCARBOROUGH: I want to ask him a question. BRZEZINSKI: Okay, fine. SCARBOROUGH: I laughed this morning when I heard the President talking about fiscal responsibility. I support PAYGO and I'm sure you support PAYGO but as Dylan Ratigan said, \"the cow is already out of the barn.\" REP. MIKE PENCE: Well, that's right, Joe. I really do believe there is a little bit of symmetry here between the issue of PAYGO and the energy legislation that Republicans are going to be introducing today. What the Democrats have and are planning to bring to the floor this month is essentially a national energy tax. This so-called \"cap and trade bill\" is a means of paying for all of the runaway federal spending that we've seen under the last Administration and redoubled and increased. SCARBOROUGH: Can you explain that because we hear about cap in trade. Break it down for us as simply as you can. What does that mean for americans and their energy problem? REP. PENCE: What it means all in the name of climate change this new regime of limiting carbon emissions from all different sources of energy production in this country but i don't think you need to look any further than the President himself, Joe, who literally said his cap and trade proposals were to pass, that utility rates, his words now, would, \"necessarily skyrocket\". John Dingle of Michigan and the Commerce Committee said people don't realize this is a tax and a, \"great big one.\" Republicans today are going to unveil a plan that takes us in the direction of energy independence. SCARBOROUGH: Trying to break this down. So where people would mainly feel it is in their power bills every week? REP. PENCE: Places like Indiana where I'm from would see a potential doubling of their utility rates but also, remember; the cost of energy goes into virtually every product we consume. This national energy tax according to some estimates could mean additional energy costs across the board of some $3,000 or more per year per household. We have a better way. We have a better solution. We're going to unveil it this morning. I'm glad to do so exclusively here on Morning Joe. The Republicans' all-of-the-above strategy, we're going to say yes to giving the American people more access to American oil, more domestic exploration for natural gas and coal, yes to renewables like wind and solar and we're going to say a deafening yes to nuclear energy. We're going to commit this country or call on this country to build 100 new nuclear power plants in the next 20 years. SCARBOROUGH: Your alternative energy source, obviously we're not there yet. The federal government may need to step in and get involved in helping the private sector. REP. PENCE: It really does, Joe. We want to capture some of the revenues from offshore drilling and put it into a renewable trust fund that will be available in the development of alternative and renewable sources of energy. We just don't need to pass legislation like cap in trade that will amount to a national energy tax, harm our economy at a time, quite frankly, when every American small business is struggling to make ends meet. There's a better way. Republicans will outline that today and I have a feeling - I just have a gut feeling there's a lot of concern even among many Democrats on capitol hill about the national energy tax looking for a better solution and I believe the American Energy Act we introduce today will be part of that. SCARBOROUGH: I think you're exactly right. A lot of Democrats are concerned. a lot of Republicans I know are concerned about the way we use energy in this country. I mean, do you agree with me and a lot of conservatives that there's nothing conservative about a country that has 4% of the world's population spending 25% of the world's energy? REP. PENCE: Percentages I don't get as concerned about as the notion that appears. Joe, you served on the house floor with great distinction. Remember the quote up on the wall by Daniel Webster that speaks about the resources of this country, the natural resources of this country, the genius of this country. He said let us call forth this nation's power. Part of that power is innovation. Part of that power is finding alternative sources of energy like wind, energy and solar. Oil and coal, natural gas and clean coal technologies. We just don't need to pass the Democrat cap in trade plan, to answer with innovation and alternatives. That's the Republican solution. SCARBOROUGH: Teddy Roosevelt, of course, also talked a lot about conservation. REP. PENCE: That's right. SCARBOROUGH: That's something we can do right now. REP. PENCE: That's right. SCARBOROUGH: Is that part of your package, too? REP. PENCE: That's exactly right. You're one of my favorite Teddy Roosevelt Republicans, Joe, and we're going to make a real commitment to conservation in this legislation but, remember, the national energy tax is all about paying for all this spending. People should see it as no other way. They want to pass a national energy tax so you pay and they go on spending. That's the real PAYGO. Republicans have a better solution and we're looking forward to showing it to the American people. SCARBOROUGH: Thank you for coming here and talking to us about it first, Congressman Pence.

{"message": "Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future. As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol. Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading \"Putin is our president\" and \"Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!\" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city  essentially protecting it  after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force. Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the \"interests of Russians\" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it. I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as \"Sevastopol\" but makes no mention of \"Ukrainian SSR,\" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia. However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol. Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations  the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens. My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago. The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine. Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand. The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea. There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements. Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.", "title": "Forget Kiev.

{"message": "July 25, 2010  -- TAPPER: Secretary Geithner thanks for joining us. Good to see you. So, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts. If they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples. That will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Ben Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right? GEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output. We think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible. Now, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits. TAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth? GEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth. TAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples -- GEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful. TAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress? GEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand. TAPPER: So, before the election? GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. TAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth. Are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America? GEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will. TAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen? GEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis. TAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus? GEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom. TAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that. GEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good. TAPPER: By the private sector. GEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession. TAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs. GEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical. And you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress. TAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt. Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts. Given the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations? GEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Geithner", "label": "real", "id": 30}
{"message": "John McCain In His Own Words McCain has voted consistently against women's health, and he supports overturning the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Roe v. Wade. These positions will make it difficult for him to win over moderate pro-choice voters in the general election.

It should be overturned.\"In May 2007, during an appearance on Meet the Press, Sen. McCain reiterated his support for overturning Roe v.

McCain opposed legislation requiring that abstinence-only programs be medically accurate and scientifically based. McCain voted NO on legislation that would help reduce the number of teen pregnancies by providing funding for programs to teach comprehensive, medically accurate sexuality education and other programs to prevent unintended teen pregnancies.In 1990, McCain voted NO on legislation to extend the Title X federal family planning program, which provides low-income and uninsured women and families with health care services ranging from breast and cervical cancer screening to birth control.In 2003, McCain voted NO on legislation to improve the availability of contraceptives for women and to require insurance coverage of prescription birth control.In an interview aboard the \"Straight Talk Express,\" McCain struggled to answer questions about comprehensive sex education and HIV prevention. He also stated that he thought he supported \"the president's policy\" on sex education.In 2005, McCain voted NO on legislation to overturn the \"global gag rule,\" which bars non-U.S. nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. family planning assistance if the organization (using its own, non-U.S. funds) provides abortion services or information or advocates for pro-choice laws and policies in its own country.

{"message": "Immigration reform was a major component of President Barack Obama's campaign platform. He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. \"I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,\" Obama said. \"But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.\" We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating. Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would \"strongly support\" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress. We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the \"process moving this first year.\" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated \"that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.\" Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill. Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework \"to fix our broken immigration system.\" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a \"a very important step.\" Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. \"In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we\"ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,\" said Obama. Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills.

{"message": "Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.) Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexicos border, we were skeptical. Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administrations National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. \"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\" The report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEAs term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\" The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasnt been studying drug facts for nothing.

{"message": "CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated the direct spending and revenue effects of H.R. 6079, the Repeal of Obamacare Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on July 11, 2012. H.R. 6079 would repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the exception of one subsection that has no budgetary effect. This estimate reflects the spending and revenue projections in CBOs March 2012 baseline as adjusted to take into account the effects of the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the ACA. For various reasons discussed in the report, the estimated budgetary effects of repealing the ACA by enacting H.R. 6079 are close to, but not equivalent to, an estimate of the budgetary effects of the ACA with the signs reversed. What Is the Impact of Repealing the ACA on the Federal Budget? Assuming that H.R. 6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 20132022 period. Specifically, we estimate that H.R. 6079 would reduce direct spending by $890 billion and reduce revenues by $1 trillion between 2013 and 2022, thus adding $109 billion to federal budget deficits over that period. What Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits? Deficits would be increased under H.R. 6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions: The ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money. The costs of those coverage expansionswhich include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges, increased outlays for Medicaid and the Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and tax credits for certain small employerswill be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals, revenues from the excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, and net savings from other coverage-related effects. By repealing those coverage provisions of the ACA, over the 20132022 period, H.R. 6079 would yield gross savings of an estimated $1,677 billion and net savings (after accounting for the offsets just mentioned) of $1,171 billion. The ACA also includes a number of other provisions related to health care that are estimated to reduce net federal outlays (primarily for Medicare). By repealing those provisions, H.R. 6079 would increase other direct spending in the next decade by an estimated $711 billion. The ACA includes a number of provisions that are estimated to increase federal revenues (apart from the effect of provisions related to insurance coverage), mostly by increasing the Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax and extending it to net investment income for high- income taxpayers, and imposing fees or excise taxes on certain manufacturers and insurers. Repealing those provisions would reduce revenues by an estimated $569 billion over the 20132022 period. What Would be the Effect of Repealing the ACA on Discretionary Spending? In addition to those effects on direct spending and revenues, by CBOs estimates, repeal of the ACA would reduce the need for appropriations to the Internal Revenue Service by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. Repealing the ACA would also reduce the need for appropriations to the Department of Health and Human Services by between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years, CBO estimates. Such savings might be reflected in reductions in total discretionary spending, or they might free up room for additional spending for other purposes under the caps on discretionary appropriations that were established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. H.R. 6079 would also repeal a number of authorizations for appropriations, which, if left in place, might or might not result in additional appropriations. Why Are These Estimates Uncertain? Projections of the budgetary impact of H.R. 6079 are quite uncertain because they are based, in large part, on projections of the effects of the ACA, which are themselves highly uncertain. Assessing the effects of making broad changes in the nations health care and health insurance systems requires estimates of a broad array of technical, behavioral, and economic factors. Separating the incremental effects of the provisions in the ACA that affect spending for ongoing programs and revenue streams becomes more uncertain as the time since enactment grows. The recent Supreme Court decision that essentially made the expansion of the Medicaid program a state option has also increased the uncertainty of the estimates.

{"message": "In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump. \"We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,\" he said. \"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesnt match up with reality,\" In this item, well check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasnt \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\" We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal governments official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products. Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,011,856,000 So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But well note a couple of caveats. First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years. Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling. So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but were taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.", "title": "Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003", "label": "real", "id": 41}

{"message": "Frequently Asked Questions Advanced Imaging Technology Q. What is advanced imaging technology? A. Advanced imaging technology safely screens passengers for both metallic and non-metallic threats, including weapons and explosives, which may be concealed under a passengers clothing without physical contact to keep the traveling public secure. Q. Does imaging technology work? A. Yes. Imaging technology is a highly effective security tool, which can detect both metallic and non-metallic items that may pose a threat to aviation security. AIT is a proven technology and TSA is highly confident in its detection capability. Q. Is imaging technology optional? A. Yes, imaging technology screening is optional for all passengers. Passengers who do not wish to receive imagining technology screening will receive alternative screening, including a physical pat-down. Q. Is imaging technology safe? A. Advanced imaging technology is safe and meets national health and safety standards. Backscatter technology was evaluated by the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). For comparison, a single scan using backscatter technology produces exposure equivalent to two minutes of flying on an airplane, and the energy projected by millimeter wave technology is thousands of times less than a cell phone transmission. Q. What has TSA done to protect my privacy? A. TSA has implemented strict measures to protect passenger privacy, which is ensured through the anonymity of the image. A remotely located officer views the image and does not see the passenger, and the officer assisting the passenger cannot view the image. The image cannot be stored, transmitted or printed, and is deleted immediately once viewed. Additionally, there is a privacy algorithm applied to blur the image. Q. How does the imaging technology screening process work? A. Each passenger will be asked to take everything out of their pockets (including non-metallic items) and walk into the imaging portal. Once inside, they will be asked to stand in a position and remain still for a few seconds while the technology creates an image of the passenger in real time. A remotely located officer views the image. After review and resolution of any anomalies, the image is immediately deleted. The passenger will then be free to exit the opposite side of the portal and collect belongings. The entire process takes a matter of seconds, compared to a 2-4 minute pat-down. Q. How does backscatter imaging technology work? A. Backscatter technology projects an ionizing X-ray beam over the body surface at high speed. The reflection, or backscatter, of the beam is detected, digitized and displayed on a monitor. Each full body scan produces less than 10 microREM of emission, the equivalent to the exposure each person receives in about 2 minutes of airplane flight at altitude. It produces an image that resembles a chalk-etching, and has a privacy filter applied to the entire body. Q. How does millimeter wave imaging technology work? A. Millimeter wave technology bounces harmless electromagnetic waves off of the human body to create a black and white image. It is safe, and the energy emitted by millimeter wave technology is thousands of times less than what is permitted for a cell phone. Millimeter wave technology has a privacy filter that blurs facial features. Q. Where are imaging technology machines located? A. Currently, there are 127 advanced imaging technology machines located at 36 airports nationwide. Airports that have the technology include the following. Albuquerque International Sunport Airport Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport Boston Logan International Airport Charlotte Douglas International Airport Chicago O'Hare International Airport Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Corpus Christi International Airport Denver International Airport Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Detroit Metro Airport El Paso International Airport Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport Fort Wayne International Airport Harlingen/Valley International Airport Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Indianapolis International Airport Jacksonville International Airport Kansas City International Airport Los Angeles International Airport McAllen Miller Airport McCarran International Airport Miami International Airport San Jose International Airprot Omaha Eppley Airfield Airport Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport Port Columbus International Airport Raleigh-Durham International Airport Richmond International Airport Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Salt Lake City International Airport San Francisco International Airport Tampa International Airport Tulsa International Airport Boise Airport Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport Buffalo Niagara International Airport Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport Houston William P. Hobby Airport La Guardia International Airport Laredo International Airport Luis Muoz Marn International Airport Oakland International Airport Orlando International Airport Pittsburgh International Airport Reno-Tahoe International Airport San Diego International Airport Spokane International Airport T. F. Green International Airport Q. Where else is advanced imaging technology used? A. Domestic locations: Colorado Springs Court House (CO ) Cook County Court House (IL) Department of Corrections facility (PA) Douglas County Colorado Justice Center Montana State Prison Utah State Correctional Facility International locations:Advanced imaging technology is used in hundreds of locations around the world in aviation and mass transit environments, including Canada, France, the Netherlands, Nigeria and the United Kingdom.

{"message": "During a private fundraiser earlier this year, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a small group of wealthy contributors what he truly thinks of all the voters who support President Barack Obama. He dismissed these Americans as freeloaders who pay no taxes, who dont assume responsibility for their lives, and who think government should take care of them. Fielding a question from a donor about how he could triumph in November, Romney replied: There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That thats an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter whatThese are people who pay no income tax. Romney went on: [M]y job is is not to worry about those people. Ill never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives. Mother Jones has obtained video of Romney at this intimate fundraiserwhere he candidly discussed his campaign strategy and foreign policy ideas in stark terms he does not use in publicand has confirmed its authenticity. To protect the confidential source who provided the video, we have blurred some of the image, and we will not identify the date or location of the event, which occurred after Romney had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. [UPDATE: We can now report that this fundraiser was held at the Boca Raton home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder on May 17, and weve removed the blurring from the video. See the original blurred videos here.] Here is Romney expressing his disdain for Americans who back the president: At the dinner, Romney often stuck to familiar talking points. But there were moments when he went beyond the familiar campaign lines. Describing his family background, he quipped about his father, Had he been born of Mexican parents, Id have a better shot of winning this. Contending that he is a self-made millionaire who earned his own fortune, Romney insisted, I have inherited nothing. He remarked, There is a perception, Oh, we were born with a silver spoon, he never had to earn anything and so forth. Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have: which is to get born in America. Romney told the contributors that women are open to supporting me, but that we are having a much harder time with Hispanic voters, and if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting block has in the past, why, were in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation. When one attendee asked how this group could help Romney sell himself to others, he answered, Frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars. He added, The fact that Im either tied or close to the presidentthats very interesting. Asked why he wouldnt go full-throttle and assail Obama as corrupt, Romney explained the internal thinking of his campaign and revealed that he and his aides, in response to focus-group studies conducted by his consultants, were hesitant to hammer the president too hard out of fear of alienating independents who voted for Obama in 2008: We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions. Those people I told youthe 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our sidethey all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So, and by the way, when you say to them, Do you think Barack Obama is a failure? they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, Are you disappointed that his policies havent worked? they say yes. And because they voted for him, they dont want to be told that they were wrong, that hes a bad guy, that he did bad things, that hes corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasnt up to the task. They love the phrase that hes over his head. But if werebut we, but you see, you and I, we spend our day with Republicans. We spend our days with people who agree with us. And these people are people who voted for him and dont agree with us. And so the things that animate us are not the things that animate them. And the best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you hed keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasnt been below eight percent since. Fifty percent of kids coming out of school cant get a job. Fifty percent. Fifty percent of the kids in high school in our 50 largest cities wont graduate from high school. Whatre they gonna do? These are the kinds of things that I can say to that audience that they nod their head and say, Yeah, I think youre right. What hes going to do, by the way, is try and vilify me as someone whos been successful, or whos, you know, closed businesses or laid people off, and is an evil bad guy. And that may work. (Note: Obama did not promise his policies would keep unemployment under 8 percent, and 50 percent of college graduates are not unemployed.) To assure the donors that he and his campaign knew what they were doing, Romney boasted about the consultants he had retained, emphasizing that several had worked for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: I have a very good team of extraordinarily experienced, highly successful consultants, a couple of people in particular who have done races around the world. I didnt realize it. These guys in the USthe Karl Rove equivalentsthey do races all over the world: in Armenia, in Africa, in Israel. I mean, they work for Bibi Netanyahu in his race. So they do these races and they see which ads work, and which processes work best, and we have ideas about what we do over the course of the campaign. Id tell them to you, but Id have to shoot you. When one donor said he was disappointed that Romney wasnt attacking Obama with sufficient intellectual firepower, Romney groused that the campaign trail was no place for high-minded and detail-oriented arguments: Well, I wrote a book that lays out my view for what has to happen in the country, and people who are fascinated by policy will read the book. We have a website that lays out white papers on a whole series of issues that I care about. I have to tell you, I dont think this will have a significant impact on my electability. I wish it did. I think our ads will have a much bigger impact. I think the debates will have a big impactMy dad used to say, Being right early is not good in politics. And in a setting like this, a highly intellectual subjectdiscussion on a whole series of important topics typically doesnt win elections. And there are, there are, there arefor instance, this president won because of hope and change. Romney, who spoke confidently throughout the event and seemed quite at ease with the well-heeled group, insisted that his election in and of itself would lead to economic growth and that the markets would react favorably if his chances seemed good in the fall: Theyll probably be looking at what the polls are saying. If it looks like Im going to win, the markets will be happy. If it looks like the presidents going to win, the markets should not be terribly happy. It depends of course which markets youre talking about, which types of commodities and so forth, but my own view is that if we win on November 6th, there will be a great deal of optimism about the future of this country. Well see capital come back and well seewithout actually doing anythingwell actually get a boost in the economy. If the president gets reelected, I dont know what will happen. I canI can never predict what the markets will do. Sometimes it does the exact opposite of what I would have expected. But my own view is that if we get a Taxageddon, as they call it, January 1st, with this president, and with a Congress that cant work together, itsit really is frightening. Advertise on MotherJones.com At the dinner, Romney also said that the campaign purposefully was using Ann Romney sparinglyso that people dont get tired of her. And he noted that he had turned down an invitation from Saturday Night Live because such an appearance has the potential of looking slapstick and not presidential. Here was Romney raw and unpluggedsort of unscripted. With this crowd of fellow millionaires, he apparently felt free to utter what he really believes and would never dare say out in the open. He displayed a high degree of disgust for nearly half of his fellow citizens, lumping all Obama voters into a mass of shiftless moochers who dont contribute much, if anything, to society, and he indicated that he viewed the election as a battle between strivers (such as himself and the donors before him) and parasitic free-riders who lack character, fortitude, and initiative. Yet Romney explained to his patrons that he could not speak such harsh words about Obama in public, lest he insult those independent voters who sided with Obama in 2008 and whom he desperately needs in this election. These were sentiments not to be shared with the voters; it was inside information, available only to the select few who had paid for the privilege of experiencing the real Romney.

{"message": "Mitt Romneys pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare. Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryans idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called \"premium support.\") Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryans plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan. The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut \"$700 billion\" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too! For this check, were looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. \"You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform,\" Cutter said. \"You know what those cuts are? Its taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\" Its a lot to digest if youre not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them \"cuts\" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget. $700 billion in Medicare cuts? Because were wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally \"cut\" a dollar from the Medicare programs budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would \"cut\" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, weve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care laws savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So its timing thats making the \"cuts\" bigger, not changes to Medicare. Does the Ryan budget protect those cuts? Now onto our second question: Does Ryans budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes. Heres what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romneys running mate: Stephanopoulos: \"You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts. Ryan: \"Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ...\" (Read the full exchange.) So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings. The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutters remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare. \"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obamas $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,\" said Lanhee Chen, Romneys policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. \"A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations.\" Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesnt have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasnt been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office. Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. Thats because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in. Our ruling Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but \"Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget.\" Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan. Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romneys plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan. Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.", "title": "Ryan's plan includes $700 billion in Medicare \"cuts,\" says Stephanie Cutter", "label": "real", "id": 46}

{"message": "I came to Washington to fight for a smaller government and get spending under control, not shut the government down. In fact, I have repeatedly voted to fund the government in the last few days. The shutdown isn't good for anyone in our community or our country. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa has furloughed more than 1,500 employees, putting our national security at risk before Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent them back to work this week. Veterans in my district are facing a possible future suspension in claims processing. Tax refunds can't go out. Citrus growers can't access the E-Verify system to ensure work authorization is approved, which limits their hiring ability. Unfortunately, President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have been unreasonable and unwilling to negotiate, which led to this government shutdown. We can end this if they would join us at the table and compromise, but Senate leaders and our president won't budge. I want to be clear: I have never supported Obamacare and have voted more than 40 times to defund it, delay it, or repeal it. I went a step further and introduced an amendment to the continuing resolution that would ensure that the full extent of Obamacare applies to members of Congress, the president, the vice president and staff. The House passed my amendment with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Democratic-controlled Senate hasn't passed any of these bills and refused to even vote on my amendment. We are badly mistaken to think there is any hope of the president eliminating his signature legislation, as awful as it is. Shutting down the government has had zero impact on Obamacare. Unfortunately, some were led to believe that Obamacare would immediately cease if the government shut down. The reality is, however, that despite the government being shut down for multiple days, Obamacare continues to be implemented with all of its glitches and problems. That is because about 70 percent of Obamacare is funded through mandatory funding while the current funding battle only addresses discretionary funding  it doesn't even touch mandatory funding. Since its grand opening on Oct. 1, Obamacare has been an abject failure. Countless technical glitches have prevented enrollees from accessing the online exchanges, and there are endless reports of consumer sticker shock from the high cost of Obamacare insurance premiums. Americans deserve to know that Obamacare is a disaster. Yet these failures and many more have been overshadowed by the government shutdown and the debate over a continuing resolution that, by law, could never fully defund Obamacare. Obamacare will fall under its own weight of complexities, costs and inconsistencies, all at the expense of the American people. The best way to repeal Obamacare is to let it take effect, point out its impact, win control of the Senate, and elect a president who will support its repeal.

I will work hard to continue to secure funding for these critical programs. These are welcome investments for the Hudson Valley, said Senator Clinton. These funds will help the for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region and will help SUNY New Paltz continue its world class curriculum for students. Bethel Performing Arts will use $1,000,000 in federal funds to purchase and borrow of exhibits at the non-for-profit museum. Exhibits will focus on the post-WWII period and cultural, political, social, and significant historic events during this period including, in particular, the period of the 1960s and its continuing legacy. This museum aims at advancing education, the arts, and culture in the surrounding upstate New York region. Funds will also be used for the development and creation of the audio-visual presentations, computer interactive displays, and films, and all licensing and similar matters and related costs and expenses. SUNY New Paltz will use $300,000 in federal funds for curriculum development in economic development and governance.

{"message": "Money woes in the most populous US state have given birth to an impromptu trading market for the newest of American financial instruments  the California IOU. Encumbered by a $26bn (16bn) budget shortfall and a seemingly intractable political stalemate, California's state government is issuing IOUs to businesses, health clinics, college students and taxpayers who are owed money by the state. The green documents look like any ordinary cheque except for the words \"registered warrant\" stamped in the corner. They carry a 3.75% interest rate and can be cashed in October, by which time California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is hoping that he will have some money. Entrepreneurs have been quick to leap on the phenomenon, with Craigslist and eBay cluttered with offers. A website, BuyMyIOU.com, aims to match sellers of the warrants with buyers eager to snap up the above-market interest rate. \"The market's at an early stage  we're really in the infancy of it right now,\" said Mark Granger, president of Pacific West Managers, a finance company offering to buy IOUs. \"It's a little unusual to see the state of California resorting to paying its bills like this.\" California is the world's eighth largest economy but its financial situation is grave. The once booming property market has been hit catastrophically by foreclosures and its wealthy elite have seen their income wiped out by stockmarket woes. Usually 1% of the population contribute 50% of income tax revenue, but the capital gains of these rich individuals have evaporated. Dismal relations between Democrats and Republicans have all but frozen business in the state capital, Sacramento. A two-thirds majority is required to pass any budget, but Republicans, with just over a third of the legislature, are refusing to countenance tax rises while the Democrats are balking at spending cuts. Schwarzenegger has proposed deep cuts to social programmes, including aid for the elderly, disabled and impoverished, plus cuts to schools, healthcare and universities. Larry Gerston, a professor of political science at San Jos State University, says this will accentuate an already yawning gap between the rich and poor: \"The state is quickly becoming an hourglass economy. The middle class is all but evaporating  people are either moving further to the top or sinking to the bottom.\" The initial victims of the standoff are California's creditors, who had received 91,000 IOUs worth $354m as of the end of Thursday. High-street banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, agreed to cash them for a few days but announced that they would not accept them beyond the end of the week. \"There's a sentiment inside the banks that the longer they accept the warrants, the longer the budget impasse will go on,\" said Beth Mills, a spokeswoman for the Californian Bankers Association. That leaves IOU holders with limited options. Certain local credit unions are still taking the notes at face value. Beyond that, holders face a choice of either waiting until October to receive their money or selling them at a discount on a rapidly developing informal market. Many online offers for the IOUs propose dubious rates. On eBay, one buyer was willing to pay $140 in return for $170 worth of IOUs. Granger, whose firm sees the debt crisis as a potentially lucrative opportunity, said a market rate was emerging of between 80 and 95 cents on the dollar. \"Because they're cumbersome and troublesome to deal with, a lot of the big investment houses are not going to deal with them,\" he said. \"And some people will just put them in their piggy banks.\" Last week, the credit agency Fitch cut its rating on California's debt by two notches from \"A minus\" to BBB - just two levels above \"junk\" status. Analysts fear that there could be weeks of IOUs to come. Gerston says a confrontational culture of extreme left-wing and right-wing politics has contributed to the morass, as has a reluctance to wake up to problems: \"Californians are known as laidback for a reason they've earned that reputation. Most people just don't believe what's in front of them. They just don't buy it.\"", "title": "Penniless California issues IOUs", "label": "real", "id": 52}
{"message": "John McCain touted his stance on immigration Monday CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (CNN)  John McCain the presidential candidate suddenly sounded like the John McCain of 2005 on Monday, touting two pet issues that have generated considerable heartache among grassroots conservatives: the Gang of 14 compromise and comprehensive immigration reform. McCain brought up the Gang of 14 saga unprompted at a town hall here, in advance of a major speech on judicial appointments he is set to deliver tomorrow in Winston-Salem. I know what bipartisanship is, McCain said. I am going to talk tomorrow again about our Gang of 14: seven Republicans, seven Democrats that got together rather than blow up the Senate, and we confirmed so many federal judges. In the spring of 2005, McCain and 13 other senators from both parties agreed on a compromise to avoid the so-called nuclear option, which would have curtailed the right of the minority to filibuster. Democrats had been filibustering to prevent the confirmation of three conservative judicial nominees named by President Bush. McCain said he took pride in his votes to confirm Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, a line that drew applause from assembled members of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. The Arizona senator also seemed to move past his usual secure the borders first mantra in favor of calling for, as he put it, comprehensive immigration reform.\" Last summer, McCain and Sen. Edward Kennedy led the charge on an immigration reform package that aroused the ire of conservatives and ultimately threatened to undermine McCain's then-frontrunning presidential bid. (McCain also supported immigration reform bills in 2005 and 2006.) Unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform I dont think you can take it piecemeal, he explained Monday, answering a question about providing visas for skilled workers. In other words, he said, because as soon you and I start to talk about the highly skilled workers, our agricultural interest people are going to say, Look we need ag workers, too. And then somebodys going say, 'We need the DREAM Act,' and then somebodys going to say, 'Weve got to enforce our border.' Throughout the Republican primary battle last fall, McCain faced relentless questions about his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, the 2007 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to remain in the United States if they faced certain penalties. Opponents labeled it amnesty. Since clinching the nomination, McCain has largely avoided speaking about wide-ranging immigration reform, arguing primarily that the government needs to focus on securing the border with Mexico before taking on other measures. On Monday, he lobbied for a broader approach that includes a temporary guest worker program and tamper-proof ID cards. We get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the Congress of the United States,\" McCain said, \"and the lesson I learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform.", "title": "CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive", "label": "real", "id": 53}
{"message": "Change Text Size: A A A Publications  Issue Brief Feature Overview There is concern that many young adults (ages 1929) will remain without health insurance in 2014 despite the Affordable Care Acts reforms, including subsidized private coverage offered in new state marketplaces and expanded Medicaid eligibility. How things turn out will likely depend on outreach efforts and states decisions on expanding Medicaid. Commonwealth Fund Health Insurance Tracking Survey data from 2011 and 2013 show increasing awareness among young adults of the 2010 requirement that health plans cover children under age 26. Of the estimated 15 million young adults enrolled in a parents plan in the prior 12 months, 7.8 million would not likely have been eligible to enroll prior to the law. Still, only 27 percent of 19-to-29-year-olds are aware of the marketplaces. Meanwhile, most uninsured young adults living below poverty will not have access to subsidized public or private insurance in states opting out of the Medicaid expansion.

{"message": "Feb. 4, 2011  -- In an exclusive interview with ABC News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., took aim at the newly released House GOP budget, saying it falls far short of what needs to be done to deal with the federal deficit. \"It's really not going to touch the problem,\" Paul said. \"There's a disconnect between Republicans who want a balanced budget but aren't maybe yet brave enough to talk about the cuts to come.\" The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released on Thursday, would cut non-security discretionary spending by $58 billion by the end of fiscal year 2011, which ends on Sept. 30. In an far-ranging interview aboard the Capitol Subway, Paul embraced the label \"true believer\" and said staying true to the principles of the Tea Party movement is more important to him than being a Republican. He also refused to rule out a future run for president and suggested it may be time to reduce U.S. force levels in Afghanistan. Paul has proposed his own plan to cut spending by $500 billion this year. Paul's plan would impose deep across-the-board spending cuts -- including a reduction of 83 percent from the Department of Education, 6 percent from the Department of Defense and the elimination all foreign aid. He considers it just a start. \"I go to a tea party and you know what they say to me? It's not enough. It's not enough. Where's the other trillion you need?\" Paul said. Paul defended his call to end to all foreign aid -- including the $3 billion the U.S. gives to Israel every year. \"I'm not singling out Israel. I support Israel. I want to be known as a friend of Israel,\" Paul said, \"but not with money you don't have. We can't just borrow from our kids' future and give it to countries even if they are our friends.\" Paul has come under fire from supporters of Israel, but said Israel has enough financial resources to fend for itself. \"I think they're an important ally, but I also think that their per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world,\" Paul said. \"Should we be giving free money or welfare to a wealthy nation? I don't think so.\" And military resources, as well. \"I think they're probably 10 years ahead of any neighboring country,\" he said. \"I think that their defense is very significant and probably well in advance of any of their particular enemies.\"", "title": "ABC News Exclusive: Rand Paul Says Republicans 'Aren't Maybe Brave Enough' to Tackle Deficit", "label": "real", "id": 57}

{"message": "Of all the major Republicans, the one who comes closest to my worldview is Newt Gingrich. Despite his erratically shifting views and odd phases, he continually returns to this core political refrain: He talks about using government in energetic but limited ways to increase growth, dynamism and social mobility. As he said in 2007, Its not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism. I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development. Look at American history, Gingrich continued, The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country. The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it. We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation. All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies. This was not one of Gingrichs passing fads. It is one of the most consistent themes of his career. His 1984 book, Window of Opportunity, is a broadside against what he calls the laissez-faire conservatism  the idea that government should just get out of the way so the market can flourish. As he wrote, The opportunity society calls not for a laissez-faire society in which the economic world is a neutral jungle of purely random individual behavior, but for forceful government intervention on behalf of growth and opportunity.", "title": "The Gingrich Tragedy - The New York Times", "label": "real", "id": 60}

They're the majority of the new small business starts. That is why women are looking at this and they're saying, look, my household income is down forty-three hundred dollars a year. Twenty-six hundred dollars a year is what I'm seeing as the increase in my health insurance. I am trying to get access to capital to grow this small business. The Obama economy is working against me. We've got to make some changes. Tell me what you're going to do about it. REINCE PRIEBUS: And, Bob, you-- in your commentary you talked about how Americans were just sort of sick and tired of politics generally. I-- I agree with that. And I think that it's really an indictment on Barack Obama because he promised he was going to carpet the world. He was going to be a transcendent figure. He didn't get it done. And I think of all the things that this election is-- BOB SCHIEFFER: Oh, come now. I mean-- REINCE PRIEBUS: Listen-- BOB SCHIEFFER: --I-- I take your point, but you're not trying to tell me that the reason people are sick of politics is all-- REINCE PRIEBUS: No. BOB SCHIEFFER: --all the Democrats' fault and the-- REINCE PRIEBUS: No, no, no. BOB SCHIEFFER: --Republicans have nothing. REINCE PRIEBUS: No, I'm not saying that. But-- but hear me out. I think Barack Obama's not real anymore to the American people. They bought-- they bought a message in 2008. And I think of all the things that people are starving for in this country are real, authentic people that make a promise and keep a promise. The Barack Obama brand is broken. And-- and-- and that is an indictment on Barack Obama. Now I think there is a lot of work to be done in Washington. I think we do need people of their word to go do what they said they're going to do. But at the top of the ticket is a man who sold us a bill of goods, and delivered on very little and that's going to be his biggest problem. BOB SCHIEFFER: But isn't this just kind of a-- a-- couldn't you say the same thing? Because what happens is, people come, they make these promises, both sides do it, and then nothing happens. I mean you have a Congress-- REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Well-- BOB SCHIEFFER: --that has done nothing. REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Well-- well, I take-- I'll take issue with that. The House has over thirty jobs bills and about two hundred pieces of legislation waiting for Harry Reid and the Democrat Senate to take it up. So take a little bit of issue with that. The House is what-- BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, but the Democrats there have some bills-- REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: But then, look at this, in your commentary you said you wanted to see a leader who could sit down with the other side and get things done. BOB SCHIEFFER: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE MARSHA BLACKBURN: Look at what Mitt Romney did in Massachusetts. He said as he exactly what he did. Republican governor, he went to a Democratic legislature, and he said for the good of the state, and the people of this state, let's decide how we can get some things done. So if you're looking for somebody who can actually live that out for you, your guy is Mitt Romney. REINCE PRIEBUS: And that's what a convention is all about, telling the Mitt Romney story about a good, decent man that gave away his father's inheritance and everything he did, he did with-- to success. And I think that both Republican and Democratic parents are wishing for their kids' success and the American dream, and not the glass-half-empty America that Barack Obama is trying to sell this country. BOB SCHIEFFER: Governor Barbour, yeah, you've been a governor, you've been a longtime lobbyist, you've been involved in politics for a long, long time. If you were just to sit here today and say what is something that the two sides could get together on--and I'd like to hear from you, Congressman Blackburn--just give me some things that they could do if they could just sit down and-- and do it in a rational way. HALEY BARBOUR: You know, Bob, the answer is just probably a very long list. In divided government, like under Reagan, like under Bill Clinton, when you had a majority of the House--Democrats were under Reagan they did the Reagan economic plan. They did Social Security reform. They did immigration reform. They did the 1986 Tax Reform Bill because you had a President who was willing to lead and work the other side. It's not partisan. Bill Clinton was the same way. Bill Clinton had six years of Republican Congress. He didn't whine and complain and blame everybody else. He went over to the Republican Congress and he did welfare reform and the first balanced budget in a generation because he was willing to lead. That's what the American people-- you talked about it in your commentary. The American people want to know why don't we have a Bill Clinton, why don't we have a Ronald Reagan, that will go to the other side and get things done rather than make everything political, everything somebody else's fault.

Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3 McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0yes, zerofrom the League of Conservation Voters last year.10 John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

{"message": "GOP Task Force, Lone Democrat Eye Trafficking Law By Emma Dumain The House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law  and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obamas failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for voluntary return to their home countries. A law known as the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act gave that right only to children from counties contiguous to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador  among other parts of Central America  Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms. All the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime, Cuellar told a group of reporters. The only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis. Members of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis. We agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible, they wrote, and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Cuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with a little bit of experience  a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican  would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol. Obama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking. But most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable. I think theres ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. I think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him. Rep. Ral M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday  and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law. He said he had suspected all along that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obamas pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border. We need to take a position that protects children, Grijalva said, and a Republican effort  to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.

{"message": "Senate Passes Obama-Hagel Provision Aimed at Preventing Nuclear Terrorism Tuesday, September 18, 2007 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: Amy Brundage (Obama) or Jordan Stark (Hagel) Legislation requires plan to secure global stockpiles of nuclear weapons and material by 2012 WASHINGTON, DC -- The Senate recently passed a provision authored by Senators Barack Obama (D-IL) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to help keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. The legislation was included as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The Obama-Hagel amendment requires the President to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for ensuring that all nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at vulnerable sites around the world are secure by 2012 from the threats that terrorists have shown they can pose. Securing nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material at their source is the most direct and reliable way to prevent nuclear terrorism, said Senator Obama. It is imperative that we build and sustain a truly global effort under an aggressive timeline to secure, consolidate, and reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material to keep them out of the wrong hands. Nuclear proliferation will be one of the defining challenges for the United States and the world in the 21st century. The U.S. must actively engage the international community in a constructive dialogue that will focus on strengthening the current international nuclear nonproliferation framework. This amendment provides the directive for development of a comprehensive strategy to adequately secure and account for nuclear stockpiles throughout the world. There is no higher priority for America and the world than to address this great threat to mankind, Senator Hagel said. Despite significant progress by the U.S. to improve the security of nuclear stockpiles in some parts of the world, there are still significant quantities of weapons-usable nuclear material that remain vulnerable to theft or diversion. For example, there are an estimated 60 tons of highly enriched uranium  enough to make over 1,000 nuclear bombs  that are spread out at non-military facilities in over 40 countries around the world. Physical security at these facilities varies significantly, creating dangerous vulnerabilities to theft or diversion. In addition to requiring a plan to secure nuclear weapons and weapons-usable material by 2012, the Obama-Hagel amendment would require the U.S. to work with other countries to ensure adequate accounting and security of nuclear stockpiles on an ongoing basis thereafter. The amendment would further require the U.S. to ensure that its own nuclear weapons stockpile and weapons-usable material are adequately protected. This provision was one component of the Obama-Hagel Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act (S. 1977), which was introduced in August. That bill would promote U.S. leadership in a global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism, reduce global nuclear arsenals, and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology. The provisions of S. 1977 include the following: support for an international nuclear fuel reserve to discourage countries from building their own uranium enrichment capability; additional funding to strengthen the inspection capabilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); talks with Russia to further reduce global nuclear arsenals; progress on a verifiable global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons; reconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; expansion of export controls and interdiction capabilities; and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations about U.S. nonproliferation policy.", "title": "Senate Passes Obama-Hagel Provision Aimed at Preventing Nuclear Terrorism", "label": "real", "id": 66}

{"message": "Hillary Clinton's advantage over Donald Trump has narrowed to just three points  resulting in a dead-heat general-election contest with more than five months to go until November, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the polls margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December. In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent. Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent). Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent). The NBC/WSJ poll  conducted May 15-19  comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days. Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee. Complete Coverage: Decision 2016 While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest). Those numbers underscore Clintons challenge in winning over Sanders voters once the Democratic primary contest concludes. Mr. and Mrs. Unpopular Trump and Clinton are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Thirty four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20)  a slight uptick from her minus-24 score last month. Trump's rating is even worse than Clintons: Twenty nine percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29)  an improvement from his minus-41 score in April. This has never been matched, or even close to being matched, Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff, says of these negative ratings for Trump and Clinton. By contrast, Sanders is in positive territory. Forty-three percent have a positive view of the Vermont senator, versus 36 percent who have a negative view (+7). One difference Clinton and Sanders: Clintons rating among Democratic voters supporting Sanders is 38 percent positive, 41 percent negative (-3); Sanders rating among Clinton supporters is 54 percent positive, 23 percent negative (+31). President Obamas overall score in the current NBC/WSJ poll is at 49 percent positive, 41 percent negative (+8). Forty Seven Percent Would Consider a Third-Party Candidate Asked if they would consider a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees, 47 percent of registered voters say yes -- a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012. Fifty percent of voters say they would not consider a third-party candidate. The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline.

{"message": "NEW YORK  The planned mosque and Islamic center blocks from ground zero got a new boost Wednesday from a coalition of supporters that includes families of Sept. 11 victims. New York Neighbors for American Values rallied for the first time at a municipal building near ground zero. \"I lost a 23-year-old son, a paramedic who gave his life saving Americans and their values,\" Talat Hamdani said, and supporting the Islamic center and mosque \"has nothing to do with religion. It has to do with standing up for our human rights, including freedom of religion.\" Among the nearly 2,800 people killed when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001 were more than 30 Muslims, she noted. Opponents of the Islamic center project argue it's insensitive to the families and memories of Sept. 11 victims to build a mosque so close. Supporters cite freedom of religion. The new coalition was started by members of 40 civic and religious organizations that \"spontaneously called each other, because we had the feeling that something very negative was happening,\" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the New York office of the watchdog group Common Cause. The controversy was triggered by \"irresponsible politicians\" using it as an election issue, she said. Names mentioned at the rally included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, and the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid. Gingrich has suggested that building the mosque near ground zero is akin to putting a Nazi sign \"next to the Holocaust Museum.\" Reid has broken ranks with President Barack Obama by saying he thinks the mosque should be built elsewhere. Coalition members are now contacting officials, asking them to support the project as a reflection of religious freedom and diversity, and the rejection of \"crude stereotypes meant to frighten and divide us.\" They plan a candlelight vigil near ground zero on Sept. 10, the eve of the ninth Sept. 11 anniversary. \"This is not just about Muslims; this is about who we are as Americans,\" said Lerner, adding that to oppose the Islamic center is \"a slippery slope. There will always be people who are offended standing next to people who are different from others.\" Rabbi Arthur Waskow, director of New York's Shalom Center, said the project will show the world a form of Islam that espouses peace  not the Islam of the terrorists. \"It is right; it is wise to build it,\" he told hundreds of people gathered under the arches of Manhattan's Municipal Building, a short walk from ground zero. Several coalition members noted that the mosque site's developer, Sharif el-Gamal, modeled it after the Jewish Community Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It serves anyone who wishes to participate, they said, and so will the Muslim center near ground zero.", "title": "9/11 families, others rally in favor of NYC mosque", "label": "real", "id": 74}
{"message": "Apparently, back when President Barack Obama would get high with the Choom Gang, he was tokin on some weak product by todays standards. At least, thats what one former congressman says. After Obama told The New Yorker that marijuana is no more dangerous than alcohol  which opened the door to a broader conversation about legalizing or decriminalizing a drug thats on the federal governments most restrictive list, Schedule I  former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said the president needs to brush up on his pot knowledge. \"I think the president needs to speak to his (National Institute of Health) director in charge of drug abuse,\" said Kennedy, who chairs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. The NIH director \"would tell the president that, in fact, todays modern, genetically modified marijuana (has) much higher THC levels, far surpass(ing) the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person.\" Obamas exploits as a pot-smoking adolescent are well documented in his own memoir, Dreams from My Father. More recently , in journalist David Maraniss biography Barack Obama: The Story, readers learned that Obama as a high schooler in the late 1970s rolled with a group called the Choom Gang  friends from Hawaii who frequently got high. But has marijuana changed that much? We decided to investigate. What is THC? Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain. When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC. THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants). Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla. Both of these have become more popular in recent years. But what about marijuana itself? Has weed as we once knew it become more potent? The answer is: yes. THC levels are on the rise, and they have been for quite some time. The University of Mississippi Potency Monitoring project analyzed tens of thousands of marijuana samples confiscated by state and federal law enforcement agencies since 1972. The average potency of all seized cannabis has increased from a concentration of 3.4 percent in 1993 to about 8.8 percent in 2008. Potency in sinsemilla in particular has jumped from 5.8 percent to 13.4 percent during that same time period. Back in the late 1970s when Obama was in high school (he graduated in 1979), the mean potency for marijuana was about 3 percent, said Mahmoud ElSohly, director of marijuana research at Ole Miss. Further, the number of samples confiscated with a THC concentration greater than 9 percent has increased significantly, from 3.2 percent in 1993 to 21.5 percent of the 1,635 marijuana samples collected in 2007. But while the average is up due to the availability of marijuana with a higher THC count, the high mark in potency (somewhere around 25-27 percent) remains relatively unchanged in the last couple decades and isnt likely to increase, ElSohly said. How did it get so strong? The former congressman said the reason for the increasing levels of THC is genetic modification. Thats not quite right. Genetic modification or genetic engineering involves altering a substances DNA at the molecular level. Producers of marijuana on the illicit market dont have the ability to pull off those kinds of lab-based modifications. However, genetic selection involves breeding marijuana plants with the highest concentration of THC. Genetic selection, unlike genetic modification, has been practiced for centuries. Think about how we got different breeds of dogs or varieties of tomatoes. Genetic selection is quite prevalent in marijuana, ElSohly said. Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost. Cultivation methods that allow growers to control climate, water and soil levels have dramatically improved production as well, he said, and they have a better idea what parts of the plant produce the highest concentration of THC. There is some genetic engineering of marijuana in labs, but its not widespread yet and its not the cause for the increase, ElSohly said. What does it mean? What does this rise in potency mean in a practical sense? Lets start with what the National Institutes of Health says, since Kennedy singled out the government agency. Noting that the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana has increased in recent decades, the NIH warns that \"daily use can have stronger effects on a developing teen brain than it did 10 or 20 years ago.\" Researchers have warned against marijuana use by teens and even young adults, noting that developing brains have an increased risk of dependency. That was an issue even before potency factored in, though the growing strength of the drug does have health officials more concerned. Those concerns are also directed at populations who had already been advised against smoking marijuana when THC levels were lower, such as individuals with cardiovascular diseases or those with certain mental illness, such as schizophrenia. But for the average adult recreational or habitual user, theres a lot less certainty about what rising THC levels mean. Only a handful of studies have looked at how users smoke marijuana with varying THC levels. Several of these studies noted that when test subjects were using more highly concentrated marijuana, they often smoked less than they did when consuming product with a lower THC level. In that regard, THC would seem to mimic how people consume beverages with different alcohol content: People tend to drink whiskey in shots, wine by the glass and beer by the mug. Marijuana may work the same way, said Carl Hart, a psychology professor at Columbia University who studies the effects of psychoactive drugs. Roger Roffman, a social work professor at the University of Washington and author of the upcoming book Marijuana Nation, noted that there has been little research on the impact of potency in cannabis at the levels seen today, especially in products like hash oil, meaning we dont know everything about its potential impact. Beyond dependency, health officials also warn that smoking marijuana can cause paranoia and in some cases anxiety attacks. Hospital visits caused by marijuana are on the rise over the last decade, from 359,795 in 2004 to 540,340 in 2011. However, it is unclear if that is caused by higher potency levels, greater usage of marijuana or other factors. This is all important food for thought, because the debate is ongoing and more research is needed. However, this didn't affect our ruling. Our ruling Kennedy said that marijuana today is \"genetically modified,\" with THC levels that \"far surpass the marijuana\" of the 1970s. Generally speaking, the potency of marijuana has been on the rise since Obamas youth, though experts disagree about what impact that rise could have on marijuanas negative health effects, in part because the research so far has been incomplete. The most off-base part of Kennedys claim is that the rise in THC levels comes from \"genetic modification.\" Its actually from genetic selection, a very old process of producing desired traits from crops. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.", "title": "Has the potency of pot changed since President Obama was in high school?", "label": "real", "id": 75}

The U.S. government has contributed more than $549 million to the IFI since its establishment. Bilateral Economic Relations Mutual trade and investment are at the heart of our prosperity, and our commitment to free market values enables our economies to thrive. Following the United Kingdoms 2020 departure from the European Union, the United States continues to be a strong partner to the United Kingdom and looks forward to advancing mutual international trade priorities rooted in our shared values, while promoting innovation and inclusive economic growth for workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and the United Kingdom are the worlds first and fifth largest economies in the world by GDP. We traded over $273 billion worth of goods and services in 2019. Two-way direct investment totals over $1.3 trillion. Every U.S. state has jobs that are connected to an investment by a UK company. Nearly 1.3 million Americans work for UK companies in the United States, and over 1.5 million Britons are directly employed by U.S. firms. The top U.S. exports to the United Kingdom include precious metal and stone, aircraft, machinery, financial and travel services, and agricultural products, such as wine and beer. Leading on Climate The United States and the United Kingdom are leaders in the global fight against climate change and are committed to taking decisive action to reach our shared goal of achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and keeping the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius within reach. The United States is committed to reducing emissions by 50-52 percent in 2030 compared to 2005 levels, while the UKs new 2035 target to slash emissions by 78 percent has also set a high bar for other major economies. The UK hosted the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in 2021, and we will continue to work closely with the UK to secure international commitments that raise ambition on climate action and protect the world from climate change. The United Kingdoms Membership in International Organizations Along with France, both the United States and the United Kingdom are among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) and are founding members of NATO.

{"message": "Debt Day: A Symbol of Washingtons Arrogant Culture of Borrowing and Spending (Boehner Op-Ed on Townhall.com) Washington, Apr 22 - Next week, the Obama Administration will mark its 100th day in power. The first three-plus months of this Administration have been turbulent, to say the least. Confronted with the most severe economic crisis in generations, President Obama and congressional Democrats have set out on a spending spree the likes of which our nation has never seen. In fact, the Administration has spent more in its first 100 days than all previous presidents have combined  hardly a distinction of which to be proud. Feeling the heat, the President has asked his Cabinet to begin identifying wasteful programs to cut from the federal budget. While this sort of talk sounds good, the inescapable fact is that the Administration and Congress have spent the last three months piling mountains of wasteful debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. Just take a look at how some of the so-called stimulus dollars are being spent. In spite of promises of transparency and accountability from the Administration, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on wasteful projects: a skateboard park in Rhode Island, bike racks in the District of Columbia, highway studies instead of construction projects in my native Ohio, and programs led by housing agencies that have repeatedly failed audits  all in the name of economic stimulus. This Sunday marks a day that is symbolic not only of our governments arrogant culture of spending  but of this Administrations borrowing binge as well. Its called Debt Day. Many workers have become familiar with a concept known as Tax Freedom Day, which is the day on which Americans begin working for themselves each year, after having covered Uncle Sams tax bill for the year. Debt Day is very similar. It is the day of the Fiscal Year  beginning on October 1 of the previous calendar year  on which total government spending exceeds total federal revenues. And in our current Fiscal Year, that falls on April 26  this Sunday, just days before the Administrations 100th day milestone. In short, about halfway through Fiscal Year 2009, Washington has run out of money. I often like to highlight the folly of politicians spending money we dont have. Well, Debt Day illustrates exactly what Im talking about. Starting this Sunday, every day between now and September 30, 2009, when the federal governments budget year ends, well be deficit spending and piling more massive debt onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. Think about it from your familys perspective. If your entire income for the year was paid out in the first six months of the year, would you spend it all during that first half of the year and charge the rest of the years spending on a credit card  plunging your family deeper and deeper into debt? Almost certainly not. A responsible family would show some discipline by drawing up and following a budget so its annual spending was spread out throughout the entire year. This is a concept House Republicans had in mind when we offered a better solution during the budget debate several weeks ago. Our plan would curb spending, create jobs by cutting taxes, and control the debt  all with an eye toward restoring some fiscal sanity on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But the Democrats in charge of our government would have none of it. Washingtons attitude gives new meaning to the common sales phrase buy now, pay later. Congress and the White House have burned through our governments income for the current Fiscal Year  a practice that shows no signs of stopping after Debt Day comes and goes on Sunday. So, Washington will continue to buy now, while taxpayers 10, 20, and 30 years from now will be forced to pay later. And pay dearly, they will.", "title": "Debt Day: A Symbol of Washingtons Arrogant Culture of Borrowing and Spending (Boehner Op-Ed on Townhall.com)", "label": "real", "id": 77}

{"message": "Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: \"Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. \"First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. \"I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. \"There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. \"This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. \"Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. \"Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. \"This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. \"Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. \"I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. \"Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired.\" ####", "title": "The Committee on Energy and Commerce", "label": "real", "id": 80}

Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain \"will make Cheney look like Gandhi.\"2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3 McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\"4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a \"second job\" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: \"The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.\"7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his \"spiritual guide,\" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a \"false religion.\" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church \"the Antichrist\" and a \"false cult.\"9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0yes, zerofrom the League of Conservation Voters last year.10 John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

{"message": "As Dems Stimulus Anniversary Nears, Americans Ask: Where are the Jobs? Washington, Feb 12 - As the one year anniversary of the Democrats trillion-dollar stimulus spending program approaches next Wednesday, its fitting to compare the results of the stimulus to the rhetoric that the President and Democratic leaders used to sell their spending plan - and see how their promises match up with reality. When Democrats rushed their massive 1,100 page, stimulus through Congress last year, they promised that unemployment would not rise above eight percent and that job creation would begin almost immediately. But nearly one year later, more than three million more Americans have lost their jobs, the deficit is set to hit a record shattering $1.6 trillion, and Administration reports on how many jobs were saved or created have been riddled with inaccuracies and contradictions, noted USA Today. By the metrics the Democrats themselves set, the stimulus hasnt worked  its chock-full of wasteful government spending thats funneled money to Congressional districts that dont exist and claims of jobs saved or created were so exaggerated that the Administration quietly abandoned the metric at the end of last year. Poll after poll confirms that an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the stimulus program. In fact, a CBS/New York Times poll released yesterday found that  just 6 percent of Americans think it has created jobs . Any wonder that a CNN survey reported that 3 of 4 Americans say much of stimulus money wasted. So where is all the stimulus money going? Here are just a few real-world examples: reported last month that: And if that wasteful spending wasnt bad enough, the Associated Press reported last month that: A federal spending surge of more than $20 billion for roads and bridges in President Barack Obamas first stimulus has had no effect on local unemployment rates...An Associated Press analysis of stimulus spending found that it didnt matter if a lot of money was spent on highways or none at all: Local unemployment rates rose and fell regardless. And the stimulus spending only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry, the analysis showed.... Even within the construction industry, which stood to benefit most from transportation money, the APs analysis found there was nearly no connection between stimulus money and the number of construction workers hired or fired since Congress passed the recovery program. The effect was so small, one economist compared it to trying to move the Empire State Building by pushing against it.", "title": "As Dems Stimulus Anniversary Nears, Americans Ask: Where are the Jobs?", "label": "real", "id": 82}

This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama. SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal. Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating. And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas.

{"message": "R.K. HAMMER (805) 499-8548 Click here for chart Card industry advisor R.K. Hammer has released its year-end 2010 results for the credit industry penalty fees assessed during the past year. This is the fourth in the Hammer annual series of seven year-end reports, dealing with all aspects of credit card industry trends: risks, costs, and profits. Some of the report highlights are: Card penalty fees assessed during 2010 totaled $22.5 Billion in the latest Hammer model. This is down slightly from year-end 2009 of $22.9 Billion. Reasons for the decline include: fewer card accounts on the books due to recent portfolio purges, and delinquency figures improving through 2010. As you can see, other than 2010, penalty fees in the card business had been on an ever increasing annual climb: 2003: $10.7 B 2004: $11.7 B 2005: $14.8 B 2006: $17.1 B 2007: $18.1 B 2008: $19.0 B 2009: $22.9 B 2010: $22.5 B Company CEO Bob Hammer commented, It is important to note that increased consumer costs due to raised APRs for delinquent accounts (often termed Penalty Pricing) are not included in the annual Hammer fee income model, as that interest charged is reported in the Interest Income category, not in Non-Interest (Fee) Income. Also, as in the past our fee income model broadly includes interchange income, penalty fees, annual fees, cash advance fees/bal. transfer fees, and enhancement income. Penalty fee income is comprised of late fees, over limit fees and other miscellaneous fee income, the vast majority (90%+) are late fees. Interest income for decades has clearly been the largest revenue stream for cards, followed by fee income. Those lines have now almost intersected, and are expected to do so in the next 18  24 months, with fee income then becoming the largest component of revenue for card issuers. Recent rule changes and regulation impacting interest cards may charge and how interest rate changes may be implemented have hastened issuers direction and refocus toward new fees and repricing current fees. Hammer forecast for 2011: Fee Income rising 9% for credit card companies.- Formed in 1990, R.K. Hammer is an internationally known credit card industry advisor whose clients include some of the worlds largest financial institutions in the U.S. and in 50 countries abroad.

{"message": "The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation. During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law. As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan. On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. \"Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?\" she asked. Brown responded, \"In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done.\" When Walters asked him, \"Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?\" Brown said, \"Yes.\" \"The whole plan?\" Walters continued. \"Yes,\" Brown said. Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response. \"That was the most evasive answer,\" Krugman said. \"If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead.\" We wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed \"the same thing\" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts. The consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, \"Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients.\" Here are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details:  Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two.  Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate.  Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary \"exchanges\" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels.  Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.  Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level.  Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage.  Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans. The bills differ more noticeably in several other areas.  Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility.  Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost (\"Cadillac\") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things. \"The Senate probably has more cost containment,\" said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. \"And the financing is different. But the structure is the same.\" So it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.", "title": "Krugman calls Senate health care bill similar to law in Massachusetts", "label": "real", "id": 89}

Hoffa. Hood is also Secretary-Treasurer of Local 959 in Anchorage. Hood noted that 58 percent of the petroleum used by the United States is imported, and that figure will jump to 70 percent by 2010. Hood said the imported oil arrives in largely unsafe, single-hull oil tankers. Hood recalled the 1989 Exxon Valdez tragedy in Alaska. \"We never want to see that again,\" Hood said. Exploring for oil in Alaska will make the United States less dependent on imports, he said. The Teamsters Union supports the creation of 735,000 good-paying jobs for working families that would result from opening ANWR. Hood said he is confident the House of Representatives will vote to approve ANWR oil exploration. The House is scheduled to begin debate Wednesday, August 1, and a vote is expected by Thursday, August 2. Hood was joined at the news conference by Reps. Tom Delay, (R-Texas), J.C.

{"message": "Spacer Back IMAGE 1 of 8 of 8 Next Key Concepts A massive switch from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power plants to solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050. A vast area of photovoltaic cells would have to be erected in the Southwest. Excess daytime energy would be stored as compressed air in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours. Large solar concentrator power plants would be built as well. A new direct-current power transmission backbone would deliver solar electricity across the country. But $420 billion in subsidies from 2011 to 2050 would be required to fund the infrastructure and make it cost-competitive. The Editors High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay. The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests. And as China, India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels, future fighting over energy looms large. In the meantime, power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, as well as vehicles everywhere, continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually, threatening the planet. Well-meaning scientists, engineers, economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil-fuel use and emissions. These steps are not enough. The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels. Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer. Solar energys potential is off the chart. The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year. The U.S. is lucky to be endowed with a vast resource; at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone are suitable for constructing solar power plants, and that land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of solar radiation a year. Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nations total energy consumption in 2006. To convert the country to solar power, huge tracts of land would have to be covered with photovoltaic panels and solar heating troughs. A direct-current (DC) transmission backbone would also have to be erected to send that energy efficiently across the nation. The technology is ready. On the following pages we present a grand plan that could provide 69 percent of the U.S.s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy (which includes transportation) with solar power by 2050. We project that this energy could be sold to consumers at rates equivalent to todays rates for conventional power sources, about five cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). If wind, biomass and geothermal sources were also developed, renewable energy could provide 100 percent of the nations electricity and 90 percent of its energy by 2100. The federal government would have to invest more than $400 billion over the next 40 years to complete the 2050 plan. That investment is substantial, but the payoff is greater. Solar plants consume little or no fuel, saving billions of dollars year after year. The infrastructure would displace 300 large coal-fired power plants and 300 more large natural gas plants and all the fuels they consume. The plan would effectively eliminate all imported oil, fundamentally cutting U.S. trade deficits and easing political tension in the Middle East and elsewhere. Because solar technologies are almost pollution-free, the plan would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 1.7 billion tons a year, and another 1.9 billion tons from gasoline vehicles would be displaced by plug-in hybrids refueled by the solar power grid. In 2050 U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be 62 percent below 2005 levels, putting a major brake on global warming. Photovoltaic Farms In the past few years the cost to produce photovoltaic cells and modules has dropped significantly, opening the way for large-scale deployment. Various cell types exist, but the least expensive modules today are thin films made of cadmium telluride. To provide electricity at six cents per kWh by 2020, cadmium telluride modules would have to convert electricity with 14 percent efficiency, and systems would have to be installed at $1.20 per watt of capacity. Current modules have 10 percent efficiency and an installed system cost of about $4 per watt. Progress is clearly needed, but the technology is advancing quickly; commercial efficiencies have risen from 9 to 10 percent in the past 12 months. It is worth noting, too, that as modules improve, rooftop photovoltaics will become more cost-competitive for homeowners, reducing daytime electricity demand.", "title": "A Solar Grand Plan: Scientific American", "label": "real", "id": 93}

We will stop the kind of constant sniping at our protections for our workers that can come from foreign companies because they have the authority to try to sue to overturn what we do to keep our workers safe. This is rightly a big issue in Ohio. And I have laid out my criticism, but in addition my plan, for actually fixing NAFTA. Again, I have received a lot of incoming criticism from Senator Obama. And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama. SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal. Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating. And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas.

{"message": "Oct. 11: The debate over the best way forward intensifies in Washington. Two key voices on the Hill and two experienced military leaders weigh in on the direction a new war strategy should take: Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI); Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC); Gen. Barry McCaffrey (Ret.); and Gen. Richard Myers (Ret.). Plus a roundtable: Ron Brownstein, Paul Gigot, Katty Kay, Bob Woodward. GREGORY: Realistically, from both of you generals, what is victory in Afghanistan? GEN. MYERS: Some sort--in my view, it's some sort of stable government. And back to Senator Levin's point... GREGORY: So we can't leave. We can't pull troops out of Afghanistan until there's a stable government? GEN. MYERS: I think it has to be a viable, stable government that the people believe in. And if you're going to have Afghan security forces that are effective, they have to be connected to the central government and feel that there's some connection and some direction coming from their central government. Otherwise it doesn't work; they're just in the field doing what they do but there's no connection to the overall mission of that country. So I think clearly that's, that's part of it. And I think there has to be some economic development to give people there hope that there's something beyond... GREGORY: Yeah. GEN. MYERS: ...what they're doing today. GREGORY: Can we beat the Taliban? GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, I, I think in 10 years of $5 billion a month and with a significant front-end security component, we can leave a Afghan national army and police force and a viable government and roads and universities. But it's a time constraint that we can't change things in 18 to 24 months. So I think we got to lower expectations. Senator Levin talked about our political resolve; is it there or not? You know, sort of a simplistic lesson I learned as an infantry company commander in combat, you only got three choices. When you're under fire you can hunker down and take casualties--it's bad--you can break contact and withdraw or you can reinforce and attack. That's really the, the challenge facing the Obama administration right now. And the, the politics of it are really tough. The American people do not appear to support large-scale continued intervention in this conflict. GREGORY: Just with, with very little time left, I want to get to two other issues. The president spoke last night at the Human Rights Campaign dinner and spoke about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" (Videotape) PRES. OBAMA: I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the House to make this happen. I will end \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" That's my commitment to you. (End videotape) GREGORY: That, of course, the position of the military to expel gays and lesbians from service. Senator Levin, will the president live up to this pledge? Can he? SEN. LEVIN: I think he, he will and he can. I think it has to be done in the, in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully. But it ought to be done with thoughtfulness and with care, and with a buy-in from the military. GREGORY: General Myers, is it time? GEN. MYERS: I can't talk about whether it's time or not. I think the process that Senator Levin outlined is exactly right, that the senior military leadership needs to be part of this. GREGORY: Mm-hmm. GEN. MYERS: The Pentagon needs to be part of it. GREGORY: Do you have an opinion about whether it's time? GEN. MYERS: Well, I, I take some exception to what Senator Levin said, because gays can serve in the military, just can't serve openly. And they, they do and there's lot of them. And we are, and we are, and we're the beneficiary of all that. GREGORY: OK. GEN. MYERS: So I'll leave it to the current folks to, to decide whether it's time or not. GEN. McCAFFREY: Well, there's no question it's time to change the policy. The key to it isn't buy-in from the military, it's for Congress to change the law. They ought to do so. And we would--I'm confident the military will move ahead on it. SEN. LEVIN: And we, I think, will do that, but we'll need the support at least of some of the military to do it. GEN. MYERS: I think that's right. You can't... GREGORY: Does the, does the president have the political resolve to make good on his promise? SEN. LEVIN: Oh, he does, and I think many of us do. GREGORY: Yeah. SEN. LEVIN: I thought it was a mistake to begin with. GREGORY: Right. Congress has the resolve as well to change it? SEN. LEVIN: I think we will gain that resolve. The way we've made other changes in this country, the military are the ones that ended a discriminatory policy against African-Americans. They can end it here and it will be great progress. GREGORY: And finally, Senator Graham, on that question, do you think the military should end the policy? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's my belief that if the policy--you don't have buy-in by the military, that's a disservice to the people in the military. They should be included in this. I'm open-minded to what the military may suggest. But I can tell you, I'm not going to make policy based on a campaign rally. And when it comes to time, the one thing I would say again about Afghanistan, history will judge not when we left but by what we left behind. And our national security interests will be determined by what we left behind and not when we left. And if this policy about \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" changes, it should be done based not on politics, but on reason. GREGORY: And, and, finally, Senator Graham, do you think the president deserved the Nobel Peace Prize? SEN. GRAHAM: If he can successfully turn around Afghanistan, deter Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, I will build a bookcase for him to put it in. It depends on what he does. GREGORY: Senator Levin? SEN. LEVIN: I think it was a, a positive statement about hope for America, as well as a recognition of the new direction that he's setting for us. GREGORY: All right, we are going to leave it there. This debate will continue. Thanks to all of you. And coming next, Afghanistan, health care and jobs; the politics behind it all. Insights and analysis from our roundtable. Plus, our MEET THE PRESS Minute highlighting some eerie similarities between Afghanistan and Vietnam, only on MEET THE PRESS. (Announcements) GREGORY: Our roundtable weighs in--Afghanistan, health care and the economy--after this brief commercial break. (Announcements) GREGORY: We are back and joined now by BBC America's Katty Kay, The Washington Post's Bob Woodward, National Journal's Ron Brownstein and Paul Gigot of The Wall Street Journal. Welcome to all of you. So much to get to this week; war and peace, as I said at the outset. But let's talk about the politics of war, and I think it's striking. Here we are in October of 2009, and it was October of 2001 when President Bush made the decision to go to war. In October of 2009, another president has to make another big decision about troops in Afghanistan, and look how the politics have changed. This was a USA Today/Gallup poll about views of sending more troops, and what you see here is a huge political divide: Democrats, 36 percent for it; Republicans, 73 percent for it. Opponents on the Democratic side, 59 percent to 23 percent. Bob Woodward, what's different? What are the politics here for this president? MR. BOB WOODWARD: Well, I, I think what's interesting, instead of trying to figure out the future, what's going on in the White House now? It's extraordinary series of very long meetings. One of the big criticisms of Lyndon Johnson during Vietnam was he wouldn't listen, and Obama is listening. He's on a listening tour, and everyone is getting their say. And he's got to, he's got to make a giant decision not about troop numbers, but what's the strategy? And I think, you know, this is, this is the test for him. Can he come up with some consensus so the military doesn't feel wounded, so his own party doesn't feel wounded? And if he does that, you know, a lot of people, even if they don't agree with the final decision, will say he did something--again, George W. Bush, in deciding to go into Iraq, the model there was he decided... GREGORY: Right. MR. WOODWARD: ...\"We're going to do it.\" All the meetings were about how to do it, never considering other options. GREGORY: But, but there, there is a real debate about this policy that has broken into the public, and you broke this story with McChrystal's assessment. The vice president is on the cover of Newsweek magazine with his perspective as a, as a counselor to the president on important matters, including this question of Afghanistan. This is played out--we spent a lot of time talking about this in the Bush administration over Iraq. This has really played out publicly. MR. WOODWARD: But, but--and I think to everyone's benefit, including the president's, including the military and certainly the, the public. Look, if we had had the secret report on WMD in Iraq before the war and published that, history might have been different. It's very important to know, if you can, what these classified memos say. And in the, in this case we have it, and people are talking about something very concrete. GREGORY: Paul Gigot, the, the question is the president had a strategy. He announced it in March. MR. PAUL GIGOT: I thought--yeah. GREGORY: It was clear. This is what Charles Krauthammer wrote on Friday in his column: \"So what does [the] commander-in-chief do now with the war he once declared had to be won but had been almost criminally underresourced by Bush? Perhaps provide the resources to win it? You would think so. ... Obama agonizes publicly and the world watches.

{"message": "Testimony of Wayne R. LaPierre Executive Vice-President, National Rifle Association before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime U. S. House of Representatives May 27, 1999 Our freedoms are already endangered enough by those who oppose them. But I 've learned that a freedom is most at risk when it 's in the hands of honest people who think, for some perceived common good, they ought to give it up. Today we are a country in shock, still bewildered by what confluence of forces could possibly lead young people to hurt each other. In that tender state, good people are vulnerable. They want to do something, anything, for the common good. Indeed, some are so perplexed about what to do that legislators admit from the outset that their legislation could not have prevented the very crimes that provoked drafting it. That's the very definition of a perceived, but fictitious, common good. As this made-for-TV lawmaking gets played out, it needs a villain. So good Americans have been exposed daily to a well-coordinated systematic bashing of the National Rifle Association 's membership as somehow a reckless societal pathogen, a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution, and reason. That is a cruel and dangerous lie. Because nobody --nor any combination of entities you care to add up --has invested even a measurable fraction of what we have invested toward keeping safety and sanity central to the lawful exercise of the Second Amendment. And nobody is more committed than we are to keeping guns out of criminals 'hands. That's obviously in our best interest. It's just whether you believe you 're more likely to keep guns and criminals apart with new laws you write and ignore, or with existing laws you enforce. Some think our insistence on enforcement is unreasonable. Others say we oppose reasonable restrictions on gun ownership. So let's talk about what's reasonable and what's not. We think it 's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone. That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mental ill are in the system. This isn 't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances. But I 've repeatedly emphasized that this Administration must stop illegally keeping records of lawful gun buyers. In fact, it 's the media 's well-kept secret that the NRA was an early architect and supporter of the National Instant Check System now in place. Congressman McCollum knows we worked with him on instant checks more than a decade ago. We think it 's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what 's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people like felons who 've walked away from gun stores --instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun. We think it 's reasonable to prevent all juveniles convicted of violent felonies from owning guns, for life. What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg can prevent your law-abiding son from inheriting his grandpa 's shotgun collection because Lautenberg classifies him as a gun show dealer who must be federally regulated. We think it 's reasonable to prosecute more than just two dozen thugs last year for putting illegal guns in criminals 'hands. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg considers legal guns in private hands subject to intrusive federal regulation, even in the privacy of your home. For a century we 've taught it 's not just reasonable but essential to use safety locks, trigger locks, gun safes or any voluntary means appropriate to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. What's unreasonable is that Lautenberg can put you in prison just for failing to keep records on how many guns you own. We think it 's reasonable to make gun show instant checks just like gun store instant checks. What's unreasonable is how Lautenberg could define your Walmart, or your uncle 's skeetshooting range, or your next-door firearms collector, or your local sporting clays competition, or any person or place with 50 or more firearms as a \"gun show \" subject to mtrusive government regulation. That 's crazy! We think it 's reasonable to demand strict prosecution of criminal activity, whether it takes place in a big-city alleyway or small town gun show. What 's unreasonable is that Lautenberg instead demands strict registration of law-abiding gun buyers, b oiving the federal government the name and address, type of gun and serial number ---not of criminals but of Americans deemed NOT to be criminals by the instant check! We think it 's reasonable to provide full funding for the National Instant Check System so it operates efficiently and instantly. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg authorizes an unlimited gun tax on purchases by law-abiding citizens. We think it 's reasonable to expect our government to prosecute more than 24 hoods last year for providing guns to criminals. What 's unreasonable is how Lautenberg makes everyone prosecutable if you just talk about buying or selling a gun at a gun show --even if you have no gun in your possession! We think it 's reasonable to support the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act. What 's unreasonable is letting 6,000 students caught with illegal guns at school go, prosecuting only 13 of them the past two years. We think it 's reasonable to demand that when a lawful gun buyer passes the criminal background check and purchases a firearm, records of that transaction be destroyed immediately. What 's unreasonable is Lautenberg 's decree that we trust government bureaucrats to compile and keep We think it 's reasonable is to expect full enforcement of federal firearms laws by the federal government. What 's unreasonable is when the Justice Department claims that federal gun laws are for the states to enforce! Reasonable people know that a case made in state court means plea bargains, judge shopping and no mandatory minimum sentencing. Even Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia knows this, even if the Justice Department does not. He said, quote: \"In state court, we average for these types of gun violations a 4-month prison sentence. The federal guidelines are 59 months in prison. That 's a 5 l/2 year difference. Incarcerating convicted felons in possession of firearms for that length of time will save lives. It will save carnage. It will save people from being maimed. \" That's why we support Project Exile --the fierce prosecution of federal gun laws that has cut crime rates overnight the few places it 's been tried. Even though this Administration resists it, we think it's reasonable because it works. We only support what works, and our proud list is long. From Project Exile to three-strikesyou're out, to truth in sentencin g, to ten-twenty-life, to mandatory minimums --what 's reasonable is what works; what 's unreasonable is what doesn 't work. What's unreasonable is further erosion of privacy, further intrusion into private transactions, and further government penalizing of the law-abiding many instead of the lawbreaking few. America will not tolerate further surrender of precious freedoms in return for nothing but perceived but fictitious promises that make none of us safer. The Lautenberg legislation is not only unreasonable, it is unworkable . . . unacceptable . . . and to our Founders who gave us the Second Amendment, unthinkable. And finally --somebody's got to say this out loud: It 's reasonable for well-meaning people to convene hearings like this to find and fashion solutions. What 's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric becomes acceptable because it 's aimed at honest gun owners, as in the violent language of influential film-maker Spike Lee who last week reportedly said about NRA President Charlton Heston, quote, \"Shoot him --with a .44 caliber Bulldog. \" By his defiant silence, instead of the quick apology most American role models would offer, he sanctions hate and bears his share of culpability for the kind of violence this body seeks to stop. On behalf of millions of gun owners who are NRA members, and tens of millions who are not yet, I am asking you to practice yourselves what is so readily preached to us: Be reasonable.", "title": "05/27/99 Committee on the Judiciary", "label": "real", "id": 99}

{"message": "In a speech posted on Medium, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a striking statistic about gun violence and minority youth. \"Gun violence,\" she wrote, \"is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\" We wondered whether this is correct, so we took a closer look. We found the relevant data on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Using this search form, we collected data on the 10 most common causes of death for African-American men and boys between the ages of 15 and 24, for 2014. Rank Cause of death Number of deaths Number gun-related 1st Homicide 2,416 2,256 2nd Unintentional injuries 1,135 47 3rd Suicide 448 230 4th Heart disease 172 -- 5th Cancer 161 Featured Fact-check \"Trump just bought a handgun! -- 6th HIV 52 -- 7th Chronic lower respiratory diseases 47 -- 8th Congenital anomalies 38 -- 9th Anemia 33 -- 10th Diabetes 33 -- Total, 2nd through 9th place -- 2,119 -- So even if you look only at gun-related homicides, there were 2,256 of those in 2014, compared to 2,119 deaths in the next nine categories combined. This makes Clintons statement correct. If you add in the accidents and suicides related to guns, the gap between gun-related deaths and other types of deaths expands even further. There were 2,533 gun-related deaths in all 10 categories combined, compared to 2,002 deaths in the top 10 categories that had nothing to do with guns. We should note that this statement is dependent on the age range chosen. For instance, the statement is not correct for African-American boys between age 10 and 14. There were 38 gun-related homicides in that age and racial group in 2014, plus 10 gun suicides and three unintentional injuries caused by guns, for a total of 51. By contrast, the top 10 causes of death for that age and racial group included 271 deaths that had nothing to do with guns, such as diseases. That said, we think Clintons definition of \"young\" as 15-24 is a reasonable one. Our ruling Clinton said, \"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young African-American men, outstripping the next nine causes of death combined.\" As long as you define \"young\" as being between the ages of 15 and 24, Clintons statement is accurate, according to CDC data.

{"message": "A dangerous sentiment on the left threatens to derail what could be the biggest progressive achievement in half a century. It's the view that any health-care reform that doesn't include a public option isn't \"real\" reform and thus isn't worth doing. This mantra has become an article of faith among many Democrats who haven't necessarily thought through the matter but who take their cues from leaders advancing this argument. Unless liberals rethink this premise, and fast, Democrats will squander their best chance in a generation to end the scandal of the uninsured, bring health security to every American family and begin the long-term process of getting national health costs under control. The first fallacy of the \"public option or nothing\" mantra is the notion that we'll never cover everyone without a Medicare-style program for Americans under 65. The experiences of Switzerland and the Netherlands prove that this isn't the case. Both have pioneered market-based universal health care. Both cover all their citizens using private insurers, and they do so for much less cost -- 10 percent of gross domestic product for the Dutch and 12 percent for Switzerland, compared with 17 percent in the United States, where nearly 50 million people are still uninsured. Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts. Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of \"risk adjustment.\" The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage. In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a \"big government takeover.\" A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate. It's not. The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable. What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them. Such questions have received disturbingly little attention but need to be front and center. For example, some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer-based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges; this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen. Ron Wyden, under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage they prefer at the exchange. I respect those in my party who seek the single-payer system into which the public option might eventually evolve. But I don't agree that it's the best answer for the United States. Though single payer has merits, especially in administrative efficiency, it is also likely to freeze in place our fragmented, uncoordinated system of fee-for-service care. It would encourage providers to goose volume (to boost their incomes) rather than improve quality and would offer greater rewards for providers of acute care when we need a fresh focus on chronic disease management. Single payer also asks government to do things I don't think it is competent to do, such as setting prices across a large swath of the health sector in ways that seem certain to create damaging rigidities or resource misallocations (as happens in Medicare). Finally, if government is the sole payer, provider payments will become even more politicized than they are today. On the eve of beneficial innovations in drug therapies, devices and cost-effective ways to deliver better care, it is ill-advised to make the government's hand too rigid. Private health plans have many flaws, to be sure, but if sensibly regulated they're likely to respond more nimbly to disperse medical innovations. Liberals should make peace with the notion that a regulated market of competing private health plans can be the vehicle for getting everyone covered. Yes, it means that unlike some other advanced countries, we'll have billions of \"health\" dollars siphoned off by middlemen and marketers. But if liberals think of it as a jobs program, they'll learn to love it. If everyone's covered and insurer \"cherry-picking\" is dead, health insurance will come to look more like a regulated utility. Those on the left still seeking incentive should consider: In 2006, Sen. Ted Kennedy urged Massachusetts Democrats to support Mitt Romney's plan for universal coverage via a competing system of regulated private insurers, paired with an individual mandate and subsidies for low earners. Kennedy knew this would become a model for a bipartisan fix for the country. Now, a Kennedy-approved model is within reach. Liberals, far from resisting it as a setback, should celebrate it as a triumph. Matt Miller, a former Clinton White House aide, is a management consultant and the author of \"The Tyranny of Dead Ideas.\" In recent years he has advised and given paid speeches to doctor groups, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and insurance companies, as well as to low-income advocacy groups promoting universal coverage.", "title": "Why the Public Option Isn't the Only Answer to Health-Care Reform", "label": "real", "id": 105}

{"message": "McDonnell Letter Urges No Delay in Virginia Offshore Energy Exploration and Development Governor-elect writes Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar McDonnell: .it is time to develop our offshore energy resources to create new jobs and provide necessary new revenue for schools, roads, public safety and alternative energy research and development in Virginia. RICHMOND- Virginia Governor-elect Bob McDonnell expressed his continued strong support of offshore energy exploration and development off the coast of Virginia in a letter sent to United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar this past Wednesday. In the letter, McDonnell cautioned against any further delay in the Virginia offshore lease sale scheduled for 2011, and presented the Secretary with the position of his incoming Administration on the issue. The text of the Governor-elects full letter is below. December 23, 2009 The Honorable Ken Salazar Secretary of the Interior Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, N.W Washington DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar, Last month I had the honor of being elected Governor of Virginia commencing January 16, 2010. A key priority for us here in Virginia is the development of the full range of energy resources, both traditional and renewable, to foster energy independence, national security and economic development. More than fifteen months have passed since the United States Congress allowed the federal moratorium on exploration and development of oil and natural gas resources off the Atlantic Coast to expire, and President Bush repealed a similar executive order banning such action. This cleared the way for Virginia to be the first state on the Atlantic seaboard to explore and drill beginning in 2011. Virginia is eager to get started. Nearly a year ago the public comment period for the potential lease sale offshore Virginia (Lease Sale 220) ended. Unfortunately it appears that virtually no progress has been made at the federal level to get this process rolling. I am requesting that Virginia remain in the current five-year plan and that the federal administrative process move forward with Lease Sale 220 immediately. Any effort to remove or delay Virginias participation in the lease sale would significantly hamper our efforts to create jobs, eliminate much-needed new revenue, and undermine support for President Obamas stated commitment to make the United States more energy secure. The opportunity to explore and develop oil and natural gas resources off the coast of Virginia, miles out of sight from our beaches in an environmentally sound manner, is timely for both our nation and our Commonwealth. Like every other state, Virginia is struggling with the high unemployment that accompanies the current tough economic environment. Some parts of our state have an unemployment rate as high as 19 percent. Additionally, America needs secure and diverse energy sources that do not leave us dependent on foreign governments adverse to our national interests. A 2005 study by a former president at Old Dominion University forecast that offshore natural gas production alone off of the Atlantic coast near Virginia would, over a 10-year period, likely create at least 2,578 new jobs, induce capital investment of $7.84 billion, yield $644 million in direct and indirect payroll, and result in $271 million in state and local taxes. The study also estimated that there could be up to 500 million barrels of oil in this lease area  enough to fuel all four million cars in Virginia for more than four years. These economic projections, combined with tremendous technological advancements that have transformed the offshore oil and natural gas industry and make exploration and development environmentally sound, make it clear that there is no reasonable basis for further delays in beginning the leasing process. The Gulf States have been safely exploring and drilling for oil and natural gas for years, and have done so safely despite hurricanes passing over the platforms in the Gulf. Additionally, it is critically important as a matter of equity that the Commonwealth receive the same royalties, rentals, and bonus bid payments as do all the other states which currently allow energy exploration and production off of their coasts. I implore you to work with Congressional leaders, as I will, for passage of legislation to ensure that Virginia participates in a fair and equitable distribution of future offshore revenues. Offshore energy exploration and production will be a priority in my administration. I would like to work with you and the President to make Virginia an international leader in offshore energy exploration and production on the Atlantic coast. It is important for both our Commonwealth and our country. We also intend to aggressively pursue offshore renewable energy sources such as wind farms, and will be asking for your assistance at that appropriate time. I ask you today to do everything in your power to ensure Lease Sale 220 stays on schedule, including the prompt completion of an environmental impact statement and the processing of all other administrative steps necessary for holding the lease sale in 2011. I am aware of several major energy companies that are ready to bid for the leasehold rights, generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the state and federal governments. Virginia stands ready to help address Americas energy needs while creating badly needed good-paying jobs for our citizens. Mr. Secretary, it is time to develop our offshore energy resources to create new jobs and provide necessary new revenue for schools, roads, public safety and alternative energy research and development in Virginia. I respectfully request that you direct the U.S. Minerals Management Service to expedite its preparatory work in support of the lease sale in 2011. The leasing process should not be further delayed. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter. I am committed to working with you as we move forward with this tremendous opportunity for the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. With warm personal regards, I remain Sincerely, Robert F. McDonnell cc: The Honorable Tim Kaine Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia The Honorable James H. Webb, Jr Member, United State Senate The Honorable Mark R.

In New Hampshire alone, we have endorsements from 83 elected officials, political leaders, party activists, and business and community leaders. * Recent polls  which are the standard by which ABC is making their decision about which candidates to include  show Carly ahead of multiple candidates on the stage. A WBUR poll released yesterday has Carly surging to 8% We know how much this injustice outraged the voters of Iowa  whose votes were ignored  and the voters of New Hampshire, who dont want the media and the political establishment unfairly winnowing the field before they get to vote. So we spoke with executives at ABC and political leaders at the RNC and made our case. But they decided to keep us off the stage to improve the chances of their favored candidates, despite what voters clearly wanted. And it wasnt just us.

Fox host Greta Van Susteren polled her viewers and 80% agreed that she should be on stage. Other candidates  including Ben Carson and Ted Cruz  called on ABC to change their flawed criteria and put Carly on the stage. So did Republican leaders, including Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. Many business and political leaders joined in the chorus and offered their support to Carly: Current or Former Elected/Appointed Officials and Candidates * Governor Mitt Romney * Governor Rick Perry * Governor Asa Hutchinson * Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) * Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) * Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) * Representative Michael Capuano (D-MA) * Representative Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) * Dr. Ben Carson * Speaker Newt Gingrich * Former Representative Nan Hayworth (R-NY) * Speaker of the Iowa House of Representatives, Linda Upmeyer * Iowa Lt.

{"message": "WASHINGTON  U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) is continuing to push for passage of his legislation to ensure federal opioid epidemic funding goes to the states most affected, like West Virginia. The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation. This supplemental funding was needed because the formula for funding under the 21st Century Cures Act sent large amounts of funding to populous states, while states most impacted saw smaller amounts and had unmet needs. I appreciate and welcome this additional funding to help our state combat the drug crisis. Federal agencies must prioritize aid to the states struggling the most, and West Virginia must be at the very top of the list. President Trump unveiled his opioid response plan this week, and it is time for Congress to pass my legislation to make sure that West Virginia and other states hardest hit by the drug crisis get the resources they need to truly make an impact in combating this epidemic. We must to everything possible to help people in need find recovery and stop the flood of opioids and other drugs into our communities, Rep. Jenkins said. The 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2016, included $1 billion in funding to address the drug crisis. In distributing these funds, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration relied on a funding formula that benefited states with larger populations. The Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act, introduced by Jenkins and Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), would make clear that per capita overdose deaths should be a part of the formula used to distribute 21st Century Cures Act funding. The introduction of this bill followed an announcement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and SAMHSA that there would be no change in the funding formula for the distribution of opioid State Targeted Response grants.", "title": "REP.

{"message": "The bombshell dropped on the Washington Posts website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clintons presidential campaign. But not even John Podestas private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way. Republicans lined up to criticize Trumps language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trumps Sunday nights debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records. Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. These words dont reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize, Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton. Then, against allies advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clintons marriage. Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days, Trump said. It wasnt exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. Donald Trump needs to humble himself, Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trumps words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth, Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: How does any woman work for Donald Trump? It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with Americas election. In the midst of all this, the State Departments release of more of Clintons own emails from her time as the nations top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trumps continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five. As Trumps candidacy appearedyet againto teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podestas Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clintons emails, which he called an October Surprise on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trumps words, however. Women have the power to stop Trump, Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women. In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct eventsand the responseswould affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say When youre a star, they let you do it hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan. He is talking about sexual assault. Theres no other way to frame this, Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor. For Clinton, her top aides emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speechesa sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clintons one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldnt be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowas lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? Clinton admits she is out of touch, Clinton suggests she is a moderate and Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy. Another potential pickle is this headline: Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries. Republicans are obsessed with Clintons use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trumps woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter. Yet, as a whole, Trumps video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call locker-room banter laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing womens appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever. The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt Americas face to the world. Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump a malignant clown. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarkstotally inappropriate and offensive. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said America deserves far better than Trump. Trumps vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said no apology can excuse away Donald Trumps reprehensible comments degrading women. Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trumps video. They did their opposition research. This is what they had, former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. She has to change the narrative. Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trumps supporters firmly in their camp. A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns, he said. That thinking might help some of Trumps backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairmans stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder. But theres a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday nights competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.

{"message": "The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldnt have expected to be shot. The outrage in Ferguson is understandablethough there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote: Soldiers and police are supposed to be different.  Police look inward. Theyre supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. Its the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians. The Cato Institutes Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (This my property! he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone? Olson added, the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands. How did this happen? Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances. There is a systemic problem with todays law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armieswhere police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundations Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment. Bernick continued, federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery. Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the countrytanks included. When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jurynational security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiturewe begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it. Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country. Let us continue to pray for Michael Browns family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.

{"message": "Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address. But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate. \"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,\" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. \"Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.\" PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked. Go to the polls Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: \"Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?\" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: \"Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?\" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: \"Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?\" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: \"Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?\" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose \"making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks\"? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingrahams producers and didnt hear back. We couldnt find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. \"People don't seem to like the idea of gun control, but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,\" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Our ruling Ingraham said, \"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.\" Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings  such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation  there hasnt been a definitive debunking of the statistic. We rate Ingrahams claim False.", "title": "Laura Ingraham wrongly says claim that 90% support for gun background checks has been debunked", "label": "real", "id": 113}
{"message": "June 9, 2009 TG-162 Treasury Announces $68 Billion in Expected CPP Repayments WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that 10 of the largest U.S. financial institutions participating in the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) have met the requirements for repayment established by the primary federal banking supervisors. Following consultation with the primary banking supervisor of each institution, Treasury has notified the institutions that they are now eligible to complete the repayment process. If these firms choose to do so, Treasury will receive $68 billion in repayment proceeds. Combined with repayments received to date from other institutions, Treasury will have received approximately $70 billion in repayments from CPP participants. More than 600 banks across the country have participated in the CPP, representing $199 billion in investments. \"These repayments are an encouraging sign of financial repair, but we still have work to do,\" said Secretary Tim Geithner. These repayments follow a period in which many banks have successfully raised equity capital from private investors. Also, for the first time in many months, these banks have issued long-term debt that is not guaranteed by the government. Under the CPP investment agreements, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase the warrants Treasury holds in their firms at fair market value. In addition to Treasury's potential income from sale of the warrants, these 10 institutions have already paid dividends on the preferred stock totaling approximately $1.8 billion over the last seven months. Dividend payments received for all CPP participants are approximately $4.5 billion to date. Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, proceeds from repayment will be applied to Treasury's general account. These repayments help to reduce Treasury's borrowing and national debt. The repayments also increase Treasury's cushion to respond to any future financial instability that might otherwise jeopardize economic recovery. ###", "title": "TG-162: Treasury Announces $68 Billion in Expected CPP Repayments", "label": "real", "id": 114}

{"message": "(CNN) -- The McCain campaign calls her a \"tough executive who has demonstrated\" readiness to be president. The Republican National Committee calls her a \"conservative star with the talent, energy and family support necessary to carry out common sense policies.\" John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate came as a surprise. more photos  But the Obama campaign calls her a candidate with \"the thinnest foreign policy experience in history\" who is \"currently under investigation in her own state.\" And one of the Senate's top Democrats, Charles Schumer, said that although she is \"a fine person, her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling.\" What do we know about Sarah Palin, the 44-year-old first-ever female governor of Alaska, wife and mother of five, and now GOP vice presidential nominee? On August 29, a new part of her identity dominated the political scene: game-changer. She entered an already historic election, knowing well two of the biggest things McCain needs her to do: shore up votes among social conservatives and win over disaffected Hillary Clinton-supporting Democrats, many of them women. iReport.com: What do you think of McCain's choice of Palin? Before catapulting to the forefront of U.S. politics, Sarah Palin was, at points along her journey, a beauty queen, high school basketball star and TV sportscaster. More recently, she became known in Alaska as a popular maverick, staunchly conservative on key issues but vocal about problems she saw, including those in her own party. Watch how conservatives say they're thrilled with Palin  She got the nickname \"Sarah Barracuda\" for her fierce competitiveness on the basketball court in high school. Some of her opponents revived the name after she became mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, in 1996, kicking out a three-term incumbent and butting heads with some city department heads who remained loyal to her predecessor, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Sarah Palin Born: February 11, 1964, Sandpoint, Idaho Education: B.S., University of Idaho, 1987 Elected offices: Wasilla, Alaska, City Council member, 1992-96 Wasilla mayor, 1996-2002 Elected governor of Alaska, 2006 Professional career: Television sports reporter, 1987-89; co-owner, commercial fishing operation, 1988-2007; owner, snow machine, watercraft and all-terrain vehicle business, 1994-97; chairwoman, Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, 2003-04. Married: To Todd Palin; five children. The oldest, Track, serves in the U.S. Army; the youngest, Trig, has Down syndrome. Sources: Almanac of American Politics, CNN In 2003 and 2004, she chaired the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates Alaska's oil and gas resources. Widely seen as a political outsider who stayed at arm's length from her party establishment, she defeated two political insiders in 2006 to become the youngest, and first female, governor in the state's history. As governor, she won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul. But her term was not without controversy. A legislative investigation is looking into allegations that Palin fired Alaska's public safety commissioner because he refused to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, a state trooper. She denied wrongdoing. An outspoken anti-abortion Republican, Palin has spoken out about her fifth child, who was diagnosed in utero with Down syndrome. \"We knew through early testing he would face special challenges, and we feel privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives,\" the Republican National Committee quoted her as saying. \"We have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\" She is married to her high-school sweetheart, a commercial fisherman. The two eloped in 1988, to save money on a big wedding, a year after she graduated from the University of Idaho, where she studied journalism and political science, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Watch details on elopement  Palin is an avid hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association. As millions of Americans began searching for information on her Friday, her official Web site as governor wasn't the only one getting flooded with traffic. Traffic also spiked at sites showcasing pictures from 1984, when she wore the crown of Miss Wasilla and competed in the Miss Alaska contest. She was born in Idaho, and her parents moved to Alaska when she was 3 months old. Some similarities between Palin and McCain were clear Friday: Both have been termed mavericks, and both have taken on the GOP establishment at times. McCain has a son who has served in Iraq; Palin has one heading there soon. So does her vice presidential opponent, Sen. Joe Biden. For all that is known about her, Palin now becomes the most prominent unknown quantity in the presidential race. Her lack of experience on national political issues, including foreign policy and homeland security, and her only brief experience as governor open clear lines of attack for the Obama campaign. Watch Democrats respond to the Palin pick  Then again, McCain's surprising announcement Friday and the intense focus it drew threatened to slow Obama's post-convention momentum in a dramatic way. No stranger to being a first in Alaska, Palin now faces being a first on a national level: the first female No. 2 on the GOP presidential ticket and only the second female on a major party ticket, after Democrat Geraldine Ferraro more than 20 years ago. Schumer described McCain's choice as a \"Hail Mary pass.\" Whether that's true has yet to be seen. But what's not in question is that in entering the race, Sarah Palin changes the game.

Reyes POSTED: 04:40 p.m. HST, May 22, 2010 Republican Charles Djou emerged victorious tonight in the special election to fill Hawaii's vacancy in Congress, giving Hawaii its first GOP member of Congress in 20 years. Djou won the special mail-in election with 39.7 percent of the vote in the final printout, released at 9 p.m. The final printout represented 171,417 ballots returned by voters in the district, which stretches from Waikiki and downtown to Mililani. Democrat Colleen Hanabusa was second at 31 percent, with Democrat Ed Case third at 27.8 percent. This is a momentous day, Djou told a jubilant crowd at state party headquarters. We have sent a message to the United States Congress. We have sent a message to the ex-governors. We have sent a message to the national Democrats! We have sent a message to the machine. We have told them that we will not stand idly by as our great nation is overburdened by too much taxes, too much debt and too much wasteful spending. Djou is Hawaii's first GOP member of Congress since Pat Saiki, who represented the party from 1987 to 1991. 2010 SPECIAL ELECTION RESULTS Party Candidate Votes Percent R Charles Djou 67,610 39.7% D Colleen Hanabusa 52,802 31.0% D Ed Case 47,391 27.8% D Rafael Del Castillo 664 0.4% N Kalaeloa Strode 491 0.3% N Jim Brewer 273 0.2% D Philmund Lee 254 0.1% R Charles Collins 194 0.1% R C.

Moseley 80 0.0% 100% of the vote, posted at 9:07 p.m. Source: Hawaii Office of Elections Eleven other candidates combined to receive 2.1 percent of the vote. Former U.S. Rep. Neil Abercrombie announced in December plans to resign his seat to concentrate solely on his campaign for governor, setting off a special election campaign unlike any in state history. By the time he formally resigned Feb. 28, the field of three main contenders had formed and the Office of Elections -- after openly considering whether to postpone the vote until the September primary to save money -- settled on a mail-in process at the cost of about $1 million. A Star-Bulletin/KITV poll in January gave Case, the former 2nd District congressman, the edge on name recognition and favorability, followed by Hanabusa, the state Senate president, and then Djou, a City Councilman. The race was on the radar of the national parties and political pundits, but many expected the seat to remain Democratic in a district that supported Obama by 72 percent. Sensibilities changed in January after Republican Scott Brown flipped the seat formerly belonging to Democrat Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts. Suddenly, national eyes were on Hawaii as the GOP went looking for the \"next Scott Brown,\" and a chance to score an upset on Obama's home turf heading into the fall midterm elections. Money poured in -- more than $1 million each for Djou and Hanabusa -- as Republicans hoped to capitalize on the winner-take-all nature of the special election and \"shoot the gap\" amid a split Democratic electorate. Divisions in the party deepened after U.S. Sen. Dan Inouye, still bitter over Case's challenge to U.S. Sen. Dan Akaka in 2006, threw his considerable support behind Hanabusa. His influence and support kept the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from making an endorsement in the race. The committee reportedly sought to back Case as the more viable candidate. After spending $300,000 on ads attacking Djou, the committee pulled out of Hawaii earlier this month, citing the inability of the local party to rally behind a single candidate.", "title": "Djou wins special election for Congress", "label": "real", "id": 117}

{"message": "Protecting Our Children from the Dangers of Smoking Viewing this video requires Adobe Flash Player 8 or higher. Download the free player. download .mp4 (159.8 MB) | read the transcript The President expressed his appreciation for Senator Ted Kennedy above all today. Lamenting that the senator could not be there for the signing of Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, he called it \"change that's been decades in the making.\" By all accounts, it is the strongest measure protecting children from the dangers of smoking to date -- read the fact sheet for all of the details. He recounted the all-too-familiar statistics: that more than 400,000 Americans now die of tobacco-related illnesses each year; that more than 8 million Americans suffer from at least one serious illness caused by smoking; and that almost 90% of all smokers began at or before their 18th birthday. He spoke on his personal experience: I know -- I was one of these teenagers, and so I know how difficult it can be to break this habit when it's been with you for a long time. And I also know that kids today don't just start smoking for no reason. They're aggressively targeted as customers by the tobacco industry. They're exposed to a constant and insidious barrage of advertising where they live, where they learn, and where they play. Most insidiously, they are offered products with flavorings that mask the taste of tobacco and make it even more tempting. We've known about this for decades, but despite the best efforts and good progress made by so many leaders and advocates with us today, the tobacco industry and its special interest lobbying have generally won the day up on the Hill. When Henry Waxman first brought tobacco CEOs before Congress in 1994, they famously denied that tobacco was deadly, nicotine was addictive, or that their companies marketed to children. And they spent millions upon millions in lobbying and advertising to fight back every attempt to expose these denials as lies. Fifteen years later, their campaign has finally failed. Today, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, health care and consumer advocates, the decades-long effort to protect our children from the harmful effects of tobacco has emerged victorious. Today, change has come to Washington. This legislation will not ban all tobacco products, and it will allow adults to make their own choices. But it will also ban tobacco advertising within a thousand feet of schools and playgrounds. It will curb the ability of tobacco companies to market products to our children by using appealing flavors. It will force these companies to more clearly and publicly acknowledge the harmful and deadly effects of the products they sell. And it will allow the scientists at the FDA to take other common-sense steps to reduce the harmful effects of smoking. This legislation is a victory for bipartisanship, and it was passed overwhelmingly in both Houses of Congress. It's a victory for health care reform, as it will reduce some of the billions we spend on tobacco-related health care costs in this country. It's a law that will reduce the number of American children who pick up a cigarette and become adult smokers. And most importantly, it is a law that will save American lives and make Americans healthier. Making clear that this legislation does not represent the end of the road on fighting back the health risks of smoking, the President nonetheless described it as another very significant sign of change in Washington: Despite the influence of the credit card industry, we passed a law to protect consumers from unfair rate hikes and abusive fees.

{"message": "Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit Thursday, March 22, 2007 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market. The text of the letter is below: Dear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson, There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures. Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market, I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders, investors, loan servicing organizations, consumer advocates, federal regulators and housing-related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge. We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes. And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly. Working together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger. Rampant foreclosures are in nobodys interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets. The summit should consider best practice loan marketing, underwriting, and origination practices consistent with the recent (and overdue) regulators Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending. The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling, voluntary loan restructuring, limited forbearance, and other possible workout strategies. I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following: What standards investors should require of lenders, particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates. How to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty. How to support independent community-based-organizations to provide counseling and work-out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical. How to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage. How to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability, transparency, non-discrimination, genuine consumer value, and competitive returns. How to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability. Of course, the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices, or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short-term post-purchase interventions in certain cases. My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation. Nevertheless, a consortium of industry-related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at-risk homeowners and neighborhoods, even before Congress has had an opportunity to act. There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy. Please dont let this opportunity pass us by. Sincerely, U.S. Senator Barack Obama", "title": "Obama Urges Bernanke, Paulson to Fight Foreclosures, Hold Homeownership Summit", "label": "real", "id": 122}

{"message": "Pelosi urges minimum-wage hike By Mike Lillis - Tweet House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically. Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap. \"This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,\" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. \"But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.\" \"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\" The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama \"missed the mark\" with the lower figure. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months. Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy. Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush. With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters. \"When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,\" Pelosi said. \"It's time for it to be increased again.\" Tweet View Comments Pelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation  sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.)  to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.\"If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,\" she said, \"we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.\"The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour.

{"message": "BOB SCHIEFFER INTERVIEWS REP. MICHAEL McCAUL (R-TX) JANUARY 11, 2014 HEADLINES On what needs to be focused on and done in the U.S. to prevent small scale terrorist attacks from occurring: \"..it's this foreign fighter piece that disturbs me greatly. Because we don't have a good handle intelligence-wise who was on the ground in Syria, and Iraq, and Yemen to identify them, to put them on no-fly lists so they can't get in the country.\" \"I think Europe has to strengthen and tighten its travel restrictions. But we need to look at protecting this country. Because I see it as a real threat.\" \"And I think there's been in this administration a tendency to not call it that [terrorism] and to sort of have a false narrative that everything's okay when in fact the threat, I believe, is not diminishing. It's getting greater in northern Africa and the Middle East. And as that threat becomes greater, so, too, is the threat to the United States.\" ***FULL TRANSCRIPT BELOW*** BOB SCHIEFFER: And we turn now to the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee here in the United States, Congressman Mike McCaul of Texas. You just heard Mike Morell saying how, you know, the intelligence services in France, and that their budget's cut, and then cut, and cut some more. I understand that the Homeland Security budget is being cut, especially as far as the T.S.A., all the people who guard our airports. Is that so? And are you good with that? REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Well, we plan to vote on Tuesday on a measure that would actually increase spending within the department. BOB SCHIEFFER: But you're cutting T.S.A. funds, right? REP. MIKE MCCAUL: My understanding is there are (UNINTEL) in many areas of the department. And I think that T.S.A. obviously who oversees travel is very important. Look, this is a threat that happened in Paris. It could happen anywhere. And I think we need to be focused on that threat. This is a different style attack in the sense that you had foreign fighters that went to Yemen to train in the art of warfare and then bring that war back home to where they lived in France. That could happen here in the United States. We've had thousands of these Western travelers that have become foreign fighters in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen that pose a threat and a risk of returning to where they came from and to do the same thing that we saw in Paris. In addition, you hear a lot about the homegrown and violent extremist, the lone wolf if you will. We've heard a lot about that and radicalizing over the internet. But it's this foreign fighter piece that disturbs me greatly. Because we don't have a good handle intelligence-wise who was on the ground in Syria, and Iraq, and Yemen to identify them, to put them on no-fly lists so they can't get in the country. These individuals were actually on a no-fly list and still traveled to Yemen and back. We had the woman, the female terrorist, leave and go to Syria. But she's on a no-fly list. So I think Europe has to strengthen and tighten its travel restrictions. But we need to look at protecting this country. Because I see it as a real threat. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, what do we need to do that we're not doing here? REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Again, I think a couple things. I think our no-fly lists are working, I think, well. But you don't know what you don't know. We need to identify who has gone over there, traveled over there to fight this fight. And then how do we keep them off of airplanes and restrict their travel? Western Europe, again, is more lenient in their travel restrictions. And we have a visa waiver-free system where they can fly in the United States without even having a visa. We need to look at all sorts of things like that. But mainly, it's driven by intelligence. I'm launching an investigation on my committee to look at security and defense gaps that may exist as it pertains to foreign fighters. This is the most successful foreign fighter terrorist attack that we have seen to date. BOB SCHIEFFER: Well, how much of a threat does Al Qaeda in Yemen pose now? Because we see now that they're taking credit for this attack. You heard Mike Morell say, \"When they say they take credit for it, it generally proves to be true.\" REP. MIKE MCCAUL: Well, let's remember, this is Awlaki who inspired a major (UNINTEL) at Fort Hood. These two brothers traveled to Yemen and trained under Awlaki in the art of warfare and took that back. So you mentioned the war on terror to General Holder. And I think there's been in this administration a tendency to not call it that and to sort of have a false narrative that everything's okay when in fact the threat, I believe, is not diminishing. It's getting greater in northern Africa and the Middle East. And as that threat becomes greater, so, too, is the threat to the United States. And that's what we have to be prepared for. BOB SCHIEFFER: So you think these are more dangerous times than before? REP. MIKE MCCAUL: I believe with small-scale attacks, like, the larger scale 9/11-style more difficult to pull off. A bigger cell we can detect. A small cell like this one, very difficult to detect, deter, and disrupt, which is really our goal. And I think we're going to see more and more of these taking place, whether it be foreign fighters going to the warfare and return or whether it be someone who's getting on the internet, as John Miller talked about, and this very sophisticated social media program, and then radicalizing over the internet. BOB SCHIEFFER: Congressman McCaul, thank you for joining us. And we'll be back in one minute with more on all this. ***END OF TRANSCRIPT*** PRESS CONTACT: Jackie Berkowitz, berkowitzj@cbsnews.com (202) 600-6407", "title": "Rep.

{"message": "Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole \"nay,\" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.) Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the \"black tar\" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexicos border, we were skeptical. Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administrations National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. \"Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,\" the report state. \"Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.\" The report also says that Mexican \"transnational criminal organizations,\" (the DEAs term for drug-dealing gangs) \"pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.\" The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly \"by land, not by sea,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasnt been studying drug facts for nothing.

{"message": "On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton  whose wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is battling for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination  fielded some tough questions from four college journalists during mtvU's \"Editorial Board\" in New Orleans. The Clinton installment of \"Editorial Board\" premieres March 26 on mtvU. While the questions were largely expected, Clinton's answers were not. The event  the first in a televised series that will give selected writers and editors from mtvU's College Media Network the opportunity to meet with some of today's most prominent political figures  provided Clinton an opportunity to set the record straight. When asked about those remarks he'd made leading up to the South Carolina primary (he pointedly compared Senator Barack Obama's candidacy to that of Jesse Jackson's in '84 and '88, which some perceived as his attempt to pigeonhole his wife's rival as the \"black\" candidate), Clinton said his remarks were blown out of proportion by a media hungry for controversy during election season. \"Contrary to the myth, I went through South Carolina and never said a bad word about Senator Obama  not one,\" he insisted. \"I went to African-American college campuses and said, 'Look, I expect most of you are going to vote against Hillary. But I want you to know that she wants your vote.' That's what we did. You can't blame the African-American community for being proud of having a candidate who's immensely impressive, who has had a lot of support in the North among non-African-Americans and has generated all this excitement among young people. I don't think it's rocket science. The fact that people are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy in the African-American community is entirely understandable.\" But Clinton warned against approaching this election as though it were a popularity contest. He said while thousands of Americans have rallied around Obama's call for change, his wife has been making change for years. \"It is almost impossible to find any Democrat who has accomplished more in less time in the Senate  and with Republicans  on both domestic and foreign-policy issues and military issues\" than Hillary Clinton, he said. Bill Clinton also said that Obama has been running a campaign that suggests, \"If you were part of making good things happen in the '90s and stopping bad things from happening in this decade ... then you are part of a culture of conflict and you are so yesterday. The only way we can have a good president is to make a completely new beginning. \"This is the first election in history that I can remember where experience  and having, actually, experience as a change-maker  should be a disability for being elected,\" he added. \"All of you who are young have a right to say that, but don't pretend you're not saying that.\" Later, Clinton took exception to suggestions that Obama has rejected special-interest funds in his campaign. \"[Obama] was the only one who kept his [political action committee],\" Clinton said. \"Then, in the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money  43 percent, to be exact  on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population. He also admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign on how to spread the money out. So, therefore, it is not true that he has run a campaign without any special-interest money influencing the presidential campaign.\" When asked why African-Americans' support of his wife continues to drop, Clinton pointed to Obama's caucus win in Iowa as the turning point  not the comments he made before South Carolina's primary. \"The minute it became possible that [Obama] could be the nominee, he was going to win the lion's share of the African-American vote,\" Clinton surmised. \"And I think that I never begrudged it.\" The issue of drug use was also broached. Clinton famously remarked in the '90s that he had experimented with marijuana but \"never inhaled,\" and Obama has also admitted to trying cocaine as a youth. Clinton was asked whether voters might be swayed by such things from a candidate's past. \"It was also an issue when President Bush ran for the first time, because he didn't answer the cocaine question, right? ... I think the voters rendered a verdict ... that what you did when you were really young is not going to bar you from serving as president,\" he said. Clinton later told the crowd assembled for Sunday's event that he thinks Congress may abolish the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy regarding gays serving in the military before year's end. \"It would have been a better policy if it had been implemented the way General [Colin] Powell and I agreed to implement it. ... I think we may have the support now in Congress to get rid of it altogether,\" Clinton said. \"That's what we should do. We should do what every other major country has done and allow gays to serve honorably in the military. ... Our guys came to us and said, 'Look. If you don't agree to this, they're going to bury you. You will have nothing.' \" Get informed!

Survey Methodology This survey was fielded July 24 -25, 2008 as part of the Hays Research Group Statewide Opinion Counts Survey. 404 completed respondents were interviewed The margin of error for the data collected is +/- 4.86 % for a 404 response survey for the data analyzed in its entirety with a 95% confidence level; meaning that we can be 95% sure that if every resident of the State with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections was actually surveyed, the results would vary by no more than 4.86% in either direction. The survey sample used was a computer generated random list derived from a database of all households within the State of Alaska with working telephone numbers who have at least one member who has voted in at least two of the last four local or state elections. The sample frame was designed to accurately reflect the actual population percentages. Respondents were screened to confirm they were over 18 and each household was attempted at least four times over a period of several days to account for non-response bias. Data was analyzed utilizing SPSS Quancept Software. Interviews were conducted by trained staff with on-site supervision utilizing state of the art computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). Random interviews were monitored to assure quality control measures were followed. Dialing results were analyzed daily to assure statistically accurate distribution of call disposition in order to account for non-response variables.

{"message": "Impeachment talk becomes a cynical game On Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: Listen, its all a scam started by Democrats at the White House. But lets be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says its raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Boehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, theyre being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, Boehners lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. Its impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBCs Frank Thorp. And its beneath the White House and the speaker So both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the countrys problems. (Republicans: This President is breaking the law! Democrats: They want to impeach the president!) And whats particularly jarring is that this isnt taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Its beneath the White House, and its beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties arent taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks. A Tale of Two Bills Despite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming Americans embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So thats on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldnt afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And thats maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesnt). In the case of the border, there just isnt a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties. House GOP cautiously optimistic about ability to get 218 votes for border bill As for the House GOPs $659 million border bill, NBCs Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a brick wall in the House. Then again, its truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014. Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoff Meanwhile, heres the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back, Roll Call reports. After the Senates version of the bill passed 79 to 18  Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a free votebecause the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out  after theyve left for the August recess. So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund cliff of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business. Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarter More good economic news: After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending, the AP says. The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline. Tom Steyers TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in Iowa The millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climates multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and its a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyers involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science deniers, elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyers group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire. Poll: Kasich still leading in Ohio A new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohios gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, its mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. Hes still not out of the woods, but hes stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago. Dueling coal ads in West Virginia Days after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginias Senate race hitting her partys own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesnt seem to be taking any chances here The bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial If you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnells rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her favorite playmate. The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, NBC Washingtons Julie Carey reported. More: The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her, Burck said. Heres whats particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, its the other way around. Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

{"message": "In his press conference on March 11, 2011, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production against a backdrop of rising prices at the pump. \"We need to continue to boost domestic production of oil and gas,\" he said. \"Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003. Let me repeat that. Our oil production reached its highest level in seven years. Oil production from federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico reached an all-time high. For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed. So any notion that my administration has shut down oil production might make for a good political sound bite, but it doesnt match up with reality,\" In this item, well check the first piece of evidence to support his contention that his administration hasnt \"shut down\" oil production -- that \"last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003.\" We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal governments official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said \"oil production,\" we will only look at oil removed from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products. Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,011,856,000 So, 2010 is definitely the highest since 2003. But well note a couple of caveats. First, production levels actually have been quite stable over the eight-year period. Comparing 2009 and 2010 statistics, petroleum production only rose about 3 percent. And the level for 2010 is only 11 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. The second caveat is that the Energy Information Administration projects that production totals are poised to fall from their current levels over the next two years. Domestic crude oil production, the agency says, is projected to decline by 110,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by an additional 130,000 barrels per day in 2012. The agency makes that projection based on expected production declines in Alaska due to maturing oil fields. Production in the Gulf of Mexico is also projected to decline. Both are partially offset by projected increases in the Lower 48 states, but on balance, EIA sees the numbers falling. So Obama is right that American oil production is at its highest level since 2003, but were taking the statement down a notch on our rating scale because the amount is projected to fall during each of the next two years, making it somewhat problematic to use the number as evidence that domestic oil production is on a healthy trendline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.", "title": "Barack Obama says U.S. oil production last year was highest since 2003", "label": "real", "id": 138}

{"message": "With the fire of a Baptist preacher, Georgias newest presidential prospect warned a crowd of thousands that the country has gone astray under President Barack Obama. \"We have become a nation of crises,\" Republican Herman Cain shouted during his Saturday announcement at Centennial Olympic Park that hes running for president. \"Look at the facts. Dont listen to the rhetoric,\" he said. High gas prices. A rising national debt. High unemployment. \"Forty-seven million people on food stamps,\" Cain said. \"Thats 14 million more than when the current occupant of the White House took over.\" Food stamps? your PolitiFact Georgia scribes wondered. Whats with Georgia Republicans and food stamps lately? Last week, the states other presidential contender, Newt Gingrich, said Obama deserves to be called \"the most successful food stamp president in American history\" because \"47 million Americans are on food stamps.\" We ruled Gingrichs statement Half True. For the most part, Gingrich got his facts straight but oversimplified who was to blame. Cain, a former radio talk show host and Godfathers Pizza CEO, urged the crowd at his rally to \"look at the facts.\" PolitiFact Georgia is all to happy to oblige him. Food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, give certain low-income Americans vouchers to buy groceries. The most recent data show roughly 44.2 million people received SNAP benefits in February, the most recent data available. Cains numbers arent quite accurate, but hes close. The number of recipients has topped 44 million since December, which means his estimate is about 7 percent too high. The number of beneficiaries has climbed every single month since Obama took office, despite signs of an improving economy. According to historical data, Februarys count appears to be the highest in any month since the program was established in 1969. Obama took office in January 2009. That month, nearly 32 million people received SNAP benefits. That means the number of food stamp recipients has increased by about 12.2 million since the start of his administration. Cain placed the increase at 14 million, which is about 15 percent too high. Again, hes close, but not quite right. Whether Obama deserves the blame for the increase is far less clear. The rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the Great Recession, which started more than a year before Obama took office. Conservatives and liberals agree that Obama inherited a troubled economy. Whether SNAP usage would have been lower if Republicans won the presidency is impossible to tell. The number of food stamp beneficiaries ticked upward under President George W. Bush because of policies that broadened eligibility for the program and more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits. These policies remained in place under Obama. Another reason assigning blame is tough is that there is typically a lag between when the broader economy begins to recover and when SNAP usage declines. The monthly growth has slowed for the past three months, and it could start declining in a month or two. Cains accusation against Obama was not as barbed as Gingrichs, but he did lay the blame for food stamp usage at the presidents feet. We therefore give the presidential candidate a Mostly True.", "title": "Cain said food stamp program use up under Obama", "label": "real", "id": 142}

{"message": "China yesterday announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will attend the Copenhagen climate summit and that he will bring with him a target for China of reducing carbon intensity by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. Coming a day after the announcement across the Pacific that President Obama will attend the beginning of the summit, bringing a commitment to reduce U.S. emissions \"in the range of 17%\" from 2005 levels by 2020, this means that we now know what the world's two largest emitters will be bringing to the table when the world's countries gather in Copenhagen. The official announcement (in Chinese here) notes that on November 25, Premier Wen Jiabao and the State Council standing committee met and decided upon the 2020 target and corresponding measures to achieve it. Of note are the following points: 1.) What exactly does the carbon intensity target cover? China will reduce its carbon intensity, the CO2 emitted per unit GDP, by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020. This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry. This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.

How will this be implemented? In order to measure the progress it is making in achieving this target, China will include the carbon intensity target in its medium and long-term social and economic development plans and develop corresponding statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems to measure progress. Thus, we can expect that the next five year plan (2010-2015) will include systems for monitoring and evaluating officials' and enterprises' performance in meeting the specific carbon intensity reduction targets allocated to them, similar to how the government implemented its target setting and official evaluation system for the twenty percent energy intensity reduction target in the current 11th Five Year Plan.

Will the target be binding internationally? At the moment, the carbon intensity target is only a voluntary action and is not intended to be binding internationally. However, the carbon intensity reduction targets will be mandatory (\"\") domestically for provinces and enterprises within China, similar to how the current energy intensity targets are mandatory, with consequences for officials of provinces and enterprises who do not meet their assigned targets.

Is the 40 - 45% target significant? Although there is debate about how much of a reduction this 40 to 45 percent carbon intensity reduction target is from a \"business as usual\" scenario, we should keep in mind a few points. First, how we define \"business as usual\" matters. As part of its current 11th Five Year Plan, China took on a goal of reducing its energy intensity by 20% from 2006-10, which has led to a coordinated energy efficiency program that includes actions such as closing down smaller, inefficient power plants and outdated, inefficient iron and steel, cement and other manufacturing capacity, and improving the efficiency of the Top 1,000 energy consuming enterprises. If China succeeds in reducing its energy intensity by 20% by 2010, this would result in the avoidance of a billion tons of CO2 emissions. China should be given credit for these efforts and not penalized for taking early action. Second, the International Energy Agency has noted that the commitments from China and the US are roughly in line with the actions they have estimated to be necessary to reach a concentration of 450 parts CO2 per million, what scientists have deemed is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius. While we would hope that both China and the U.S. will seek to raise the level of their ambition, both proposals are substantial and require real improvements in energy efficiency and low-carbon energy to achieve. The other important thing to remember is the significance of the carbon intensity target for creating the proper framework and incentives for reducing emissions. As noted above, a carbon intensity target will require each province and major enterprise to measure, report and reduce their CO2 emissions and energy consumption, year-on-year, acting as a driver for greater efficiency and renewables. In this way, the carbon intensity target is similar to the US greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule or the cap-and-trade system in the current climate legislation before Congress, which put in place the proper incentives and systems to transition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy. Provinces, local governments and enterprises will need to establish and improve systems for measuring and reporting emissions, and there will be increasing pressure on these enterprises and provinces to enact measures within their development plans for making continuous improvements in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At the national level, China will need to continue and accelerate its policies to boost energy efficiency and renewables, and it will need to build its capacity to measure and report emissions for its national greenhouse gas inventory on a yearly basis (something which EPA and China's National Development and Reform Commission have recently agreed to cooperate on). Just as important as the targets they have set for themselves, China and the US must continue to accelerate their efforts to develop low carbon economies based on energy efficiency, renewables, and the development of clean technologies such as smart grids and electric vehicles. Both countries stand to benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy, by growing new clean industries and jobs, reducing their independence on dirty fossil fuels, and reducing their contribution to climate change and environmental damage. China can achieve a substantial reduction in its carbon intensity while continuing to grow its economy and providing an improved standard of living and a better environment for its citizens. China's carbon intensity target is certainly a step in the right direction, and it provides the right incentives for future improvements in reducing emissions. Following the U.S.'s own emissions reduction announcement and the recent bilateral clean energy initiatives announced during President Obama's visit, we are beginning to see the outlines for a meaningful framework agreement in Copenhagen and a foundation for both countries to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change.", "title": "Switchboard, from NRDC :: Barbara Finamore's Blog :: Chinas Carbon Intensity Target", "label": "real", "id": 146}

Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the web. Recent data shows that nearly 50 percent of adults are active on social networks, nearly two-thirds watch online videos on sites such as YouTube, while over seven million people have joined the fastest-growing online member community, Twitter. Apparently no one has faxed that data to congressional Democrats, however, as the vast majority has yet to incorporate many of these popular technologies into their day-to-day communications.

{"message": "WASHINGTON  The following is a parial transcript of the June 29, 2008, edition of \"FOX News Sunday With Chris Wallace\": Click here to see Part 1 of the transcript, featuring a discussion between vice presidential hopefuls, Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Ed Rendell. \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" HOST CHRIS WALLACE: The last three presidential elections, Democrats have faced challenges from independent candidate Ralph Nader. Well, this time Republicans have their own problem, Bob Barr, the former Republican Congressman from Georgia, who is now the Libertarian Party nominee for president, and he joins us from Portland, Oregon. Congressman, you say the Republican Party has no vision, no agenda and a candidate who provides no excitement. What's wrong with John McCain? FORMER REP. BOB BARR: What's wrong with John McCain is symptomatic of what's wrong with the Republican Party in these first years of the 21st century. They talk one thing but do something different, and that's become very obvious to the American people. And when you look, for example, at what the Republican Party and the Congress has done since losing their majorities in 2006, you see absolutely no new program, new leadership or vision put forward. And that's one of the reasons, Chris, why I think we see over 80 percent of the American people concluding that the country is on the wrong track and going in the wrong direction. WALLACE: But in a race between John McCain and Barack Obama, as a longtime now former conservative Republican, don't you think McCain honestly would be the better president? BARR: This is very much a mixed bag, Chris. For example, on some of the civil liberties and privacy issues with which I and the Libertarian Party are very concerned, Senator Obama clearly is much better. On other issues, those relating to the cost of government and government spending, while neither candidate is good, Senator Obama clearly would favor a more expansive federal spending policy. So it's very much a mixed bag, but neither of these candidates is talking about the deep cuts in government spending and returning power to the people that we are. WALLACE: What are your major beefs -- you said they have retreated from principle, but you weren't very specific. What are your major beefs with McCain and the Republicans right now? BARR: Well, let's take, as just one example, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Nobody is really asking the question, \"Why does the government, our own government, need to be spying on its own citizens -- that is, U.S. citizens -- in this country, without some good reason?\" The legislation that is now pending before the Senate, that just passed the House, that Senator McCain supports would provide the authority for the federal government to surveille American citizens in their own country without any suspicion whatsoever that they're engaging in discussions with terrorists or about criminal activity. This is a fundamental issue that goes to the very nature and power of our government, but nobody's really talking about it. WALLACE: But in those cases, and correct me if I'm wrong on foreign intelligence surveillance, they cannot issue a wiretap, a warrantless wiretap, unless it's communications between someone in this country and someone outside the country where they have reason to suspect that there is a terrorist connection. BARR: The first part of what you said, Chris, is absolutely correct. The second part is not. The government does not under this legislation need to establish any link whatsoever between the U.S. citizen that they're seeking to surveille and suspected terrorist activity or contacts. All they have to do is establish that they think one of the parties to that conversation is not inside the United States. This is far too broad an authority for the federal government to have. WALLACE: According, Congressman Barr, to a recent national poll, you get 3 percent of the vote, and mostly from people who say that otherwise, if you weren't in the race, they would vote Republican, especially in a few states like Colorado, like your home state of Georgia. Couldn't you end up having the balance of power and tipping those states from McCain to Obama? BARR: First of all, those polls -- this is very, very early in the campaign. We anticipate once we really launch our campaign full- time after July 4th to see those numbers increase, not just in those couple of states that you mentioned, but elsewhere around the country. And of course, I and the Libertarian Party will be on the ballot in, we hope, all 50 states, but certainly 49 states. The fact of the matter is that the American people are hungry, particularly young people, for a new vision, a new choice, to open up the political system once again and not feel bound by the artificial constraints of the two-party system. That's why it's important that I'm in this race, not as a spoiler for anybody any more than Senator McCain or Senator Obama would be a spoiler for Bob Barr. WALLACE: But I have to ask you the question that is always asked of Ralph Nader. You would have no qualms if, because of your involvement, you ended up helping elect President Obama? BARR: If Senator Obama wins on November 4th and Senator McCain and I lose, it will be because he presented a vision and a platform and a candidacy to the American people that resonated with a plurality of the voters. That's what each of those candidates needs to do. That's what I intend to do. And that's, I think, what the American people want. They're not so concerned anymore about partisanship over principle. WALLACE: All right. Let's talk a little bit about Bob Barr. Libertarians generally, I think you'd agree, favor smaller government and few foreign entanglements, but let's take a look at your record. You voted for the Patriot Act permitting more government surveillance, the thing that you just decried. You voted to authorize the war in Iraq. You introduced back in the '90s the Defense of Marriage Act and you introduced the so-called \"Barr Amendment\" against medical marijuana. Congressman, how does that record make you a Libertarian? BARR: Well, what makes me a Libertarian is the fact that I deeply and truly believe in the Libertarian platform and what resonates with most Americans, and that is to shrink the size of the federal government. Let's take just one example there, the Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act simply stands for the proposition that each state can set its own definition of marriage and can't be forced to adopt a different definition of marriage forced on it by another state. That's a very conservative principle reflecting the fundamental notion of states' rights in our country. WALLACE: But what about voting for the war in Iraq, voting for the Patriot Act, voting -- in fact, introducing the amendment to ban the legalization of the medical use of marijuana? BARR: With regard to the Patriot Act, I have fought over the last five years since leaving the Congress to limit or, better even yet, repeal the Patriot Act, and I was able in the Congress to secure a number of sunset provisions for the provisions in the Patriot Act, so we would have the opportunity to go back and review them and look at them. The powers in the Patriot Act have been used and abused by the Bush administration far in excess of what the Congress intended for it, and it's those abuses that have led I and a lot of other folks who voted for it under false pretenses essentially to work against it. With regard to the vote for hostilities in Iraq, that was a vote that was based on what we now know to be inappropriate and erroneously analyzed intelligence. That vote certainly was not intended -- was not presented to the Congress or myself in the Congress at the time as a vote for a multiyear, perhaps multidecade, occupation of Iraq. Here again, the administration has taken an inch and gone a mile, sometimes in very clear contravention of what Congress intended. WALLACE: So you're willing to take no personal responsibility and say, \"Hey, I was wrong?\" BARR: Oh, I do. I just said that I was wrong with regard to the Patriot Act, entrusting the administration with its assurances that the act would not be used and abused. And I certainly was wrong, along with a lot of others in the Congress, who now realize that their vote in support of military operations in Iraq was not what the administration intended. They intended to occupy the country even though they didn't tell us or the American people that at the time. WALLACE: Finally, Congressman, let's talk about your viability as a candidate and the viability of your campaign. You have no campaign headquarters. You have yet to hold a single fundraiser. Best we can tell, you have about $300,000 in donations. Why should American voters trying to make a decision about November take you and your campaign seriously? BARR: The campaign is really just beginning. We do have a campaign headquarters. It will be in Atlanta, Georgia. We already have an entire staff in place, including Ross Perot's former campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, finance director. We have an Internet team that worked for Ron Paul. We have held a number of fundraisers. We will be holding more. And we're, of course, launching a nationwide fundraising effort through the Internet. I think the American people will be very surprised and very pleased with what they see out of the Barr 2008 campaign over the coming months. WALLACE: Congressman Barr, we are going to have to leave it there. We want to thank you so much for getting up early today to talk with us, and safe travels on the campaign trail, sir. BARR: Thank you, Chris.

{"message": "Officials from the two prior administrations, of governors Paul Cellucci and Jane Swift, could not be reached last night, leaving it unclear whether their aides took similar actions regarding hard drives, e-mails, and computer servers. They have an obligation as a public official to preserve their records, Galvin said. Electronic records are held to the same standard as paper records. Theres no question. Theyre not in some lesser standard. Galvin pointed out that, in 1997, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the governor is not explicitly included in the Public Records Law. He said that means that e-mails dont have to be released to the public, but the governors office still has to preserve them and turn them over to the state archivist. I dont sell things to people who work for me, said Galvin, a Democrat. Ive heard of people getting their chair or something as a gift. But generally if you work for me you dont take your laptop with you when you leave. Secretary of State William F. Galvin, who oversees the state Public Records Law, said it appeared odd that state property - in this case, hard drives - was essentially being sold to private individuals. She accused Patrick of doing the Obama campaigns dirty work and called it one in a series of political attacks to distract from Obamas horrible record on jobs. Patrick, a Democrat, is a close friend and supporter of President Obama, and is expected to play a prominent role in his reelection campaign. In leaving office, the governors staff complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice, she said. Some employees exercised the option to purchase computer equipment when they left. They did so openly with personal checks. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governors aides did nothing wrong. The governors office has found no e-mails from 2002-2006 in our possession, Reilly said in a statement. Before the current administration took office, the computers used during that time period were replaced and the server used during that time period was taken out of service, all files were removed from it, and it was also replaced. As a result, Patricks office, which has been bombarded with inquiries for records from the Romney era, has no electronic record of any Romney administration e-mails, Reilly said. Romney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governors office replaced just before Governor Deval Patricks staff showed up to take power in January 2007, according to Mark Reilly, Patricks chief legal counsel. Just before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governors office and first ran for president, 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administrations e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to interviews and records obtained by the Globe. Just before leaving office, Romneys staff went before the Records Conservation Board, which is made up of appointees from various state agencies and reviews public record retention. In some cases, the Romney administration was given permission to destroy records, Galvin said, oftentimes because they were redundant. I know that all of the Romney materials were dealt with by the public records board, Galvin said. That doesnt mean that what was portrayed to the records board was a complete and accurate summary. I dont know that. Mark Nielsen, who was Romneys chief legal counsel, bought his hard drive on Dec. 12, 2006, just over two weeks before Patrick administration officials took over the governors office. The longstanding practice in the governors office was to give employees the option to buy old equipment when they were leaving office, and certain employees, including me, did that, Nielsen told the Globe. But those purchases were in conformance with the law and with longstanding executive branch practice. Im confident that we complied with the letter and the spirit of the law, he added. When asked why he would want to purchase his hard drive, he said, Employees were given that option and it was my understanding that it was a longstanding practice in the governors office. When asked about replacing the remaining computers and wiping the server clean, he said, All I can tell you is we fully complied with the law and complied with longstanding executive branch practice. Nothing unusual was done. Pam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, said Romney administration officials may not have violated the letter of the state Public Records Law, but may have run afoul of its spirit. Information that was generated in the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth, unless it was personal in nature, she said. There is a place for purchasing of surplus property, but there are procedures to do that. And it seems that we are, as a Commonwealth, losing something if all records were deleted. All told, 11 Romney administration officials bought 17 hard drives from the governors office, paying $65 for each one, according to copies of canceled checks that they wrote and members of the current administration. Many of the aides wrote equipment or hard drives in the memo space on their checks. Beth E. Myers, who was Romneys chief of staff, bought her hard drive on Aug. 18, 2006, the same month that she left state employment. She later became Romneys campaign manager. Peter G. Flaherty, who was Romneys deputy chief of staff, bought the hard drive from his computer on Nov. 3, 2006, four days before Patrick was elected, defeating his Republican opponent, Kerry Healey, who was Romneys lieutenant governor. Flaherty later became the Romney campaigns chief liaison to social conservatives. The rest of the hard drives were bought in November and December of 2006 by other aides. While Patrick aides said they do not have any electronic records of Romney administration e-mails, Galvin said there are 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from the Romney era at the state archives in Boston. In 2009, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston was embroiled in controversy after one of his top aides, Michael J. Kineavy, acknowledged that he had deleted nearly every e-mail he sent or received over the previous five years. The law requires municipal employees to preserve e-mails for at least two years, even if they have no informational or evidential value, and provides for penalties of up to a year in jail. A nine-month investigation by Attorney General Martha Coakleys office concluded, however, that the destruction of the e-mails was not a crime because Kineavy was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence from the public.

{"message": "As Americans Save Money, their Government Spends with Reckless Abandon Posted by Kevin Boland on January 5th, 2010 Last month, the New York Times wrote a story about the rise in the personal savings rate - an encouraging sign that American families are living within their means. The Times reported that [t]his was the year of the return to financial sobriety. Unfortunately, the same cant be said for out-of-touch Washington Democrats. Michael Mandel, the chief economist at Business Week, noted that Most other journalists and economists have take [sic] the same position-that Americans have reacted to the recession by saving more. But for the U.S. economy as a whole, the savings rate has not gone up-its actually fallen. How can that be? The answer is simple: government spending has exploded over the past year, which explains the discrepancies in the following chart: Mandel explained: What we see here is that the net national savings-the sum of personal, corporate, and government savings, net of depreciation-has been plunging rather than rising. The net national savings rate fell to -2.5% in the third quarter of 2009, its lowest level since the Great Depression. Thats astounding low the government is running such big deficits that they swamp the savings gains in the private sectors . Heres another way of putting it: The government is borrowing a lot of money and transferring it to the private sector, through fiscal and monetary stimulus. The private sector is using some of those transfers to boost savings. But on net, the countrys savings rate as a whole is falling. In other words, the federal government is overwhelming the private sector with deficit spending. The House Budget Committee Republican Staff complied a lengthy list of all the Democrats spending in last year: Democrats need to abandon their job-killing agenda thats burdening families and small businesses with tax hikes and burying our kids and grandkids under a mountain of debt. All year long, House Republicans have been offering better solutions on the budget, energy, and health care - solutions that recognize that we need to empower the American people, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaks in a ceremony in Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz in 300 kms 186 (miles) south of capital Tehran, Iran, Monday April, 9, 2007. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said at a ceremony at the enrichment facility at Natanz, Monday, that Iran was now capable of enriching nuclear fuel \"on an industrial scale.\" Asked if Iran has begun injecting uranium gas into 3,000 centrifuges for enrichment, top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani replied, \"Yes.\" He did not elaborate, but it was the first confirmation that Iran had installed the larger set of centrifuges after months of saying it intends to do so. (Hasan Sarbakhshian/ AP Photo) Although Iran has condemned the 2001 al-Qaida attacks on New York and Washington in the past, this was the third time in a week that Ahmadinejad questioned the death toll, who was behind the attacks and how it happened. \"Four or five years ago, a suspicious event occurred in New York. A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed but never published their names,\" Ahmadinejad told Iranians in the holy city of Qom. Under this pretext, the U.S. \"attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed only in Iraq,\" Ahmadinejad said in the speech broadcast live on state-run television. On the last anniversary of the attacks, the names of 2,750 victims killed in New York were read aloud at a memorial ceremony. In Washington, the State Department rejected the comments out of hand, calling them \"another example of misinformed misguided rhetoric\" from the Iranian leader. \"I am not sure what one says about a statement like that,\" spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. \"It leaves one speechless. It is misguided, misinformed rhetoric. I can't tell you whether or not it is something he truly believes or if this is just a warped attempt to try to shape public opinion in Iran or elsewhere.\" Last year, Ahmadinejad raised questions over the attacks, saying \"what caused it, what were the conditions that led to it, who truly was involved\" needed to be examined. Ahmadinejad has said the attacks were a result of \"mismanaging and inhumane managing of the world by the U.S.\" and should not be turned into another Holocaust \"used for slaughtering people.\" Although Iran has condemned the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the campaigns toppled the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, two regional threats to Iran.", "title": "11 Pretext For Afghanistan and Iraq Invasions", "label": "real", "id": 156}
{"message": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn't unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt. He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show. Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged? The answer may never be known, but Castile's stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile's girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath. The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile's killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana. The Castile video \"is pretty horrific,\" said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. \"There are things we don't know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases  whether explicit or implicit  about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.\" Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors. Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt. The records show no convictions for more serious crimes. No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data. But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race  and  Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites. The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected. The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile's stop since shortly after the shooting. It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks. Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him \"for no apparent reason\" after he reached for his ID. Valerie Castile said she thinks her son \"was just black in the wrong place.\" Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop. \"Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,\" said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. But the statistics can't simply be attributed to racial bias among police. \"When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,\" said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. \"That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.\" Last year, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures. Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers. The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing. \"Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we're facing ambiguous situations,\" Fridell said. \"A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren't going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.\" ( Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

{"message": "Go to   and check out Bill Clinton's syrupy five minute ad for Hillary. He introduces the commercial by saying that he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background. His version of her biography is about as reliable as if it appeared in Pravda! So, I wanted to make a few corrections: Bill says: Hillary never wanted to run for public office, but she did want to work at public service. The true facts are: When Clinton was considering not running for another term as Governor of Arkansas in 1990, Hillary said she would run if he didn't. She and Bill even had me take two surveys to assess her chances of winning. The conclusion was that she couldn't win because people would just see her as a seat warmer for when Bill came back licking his wounds after losing for president. So she didn't run. Bill did and won. But there is no question she had her eye on public office, as opposed to service, long ago. Bill says: In law school Hillary worked on legal services for the poor. The true facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal. Bill says: Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids. The true facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him. Bill says: Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers. The true facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She only joined the prestigious Rose Law Firm after Bill became Attorney General and made partner only after he was elected Governor. Bill says: President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its Chairman. The true facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman. Bill says: She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital. The true facts are: Yes she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Wal-Mart board of directors, for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices. Bill says: Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994 but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance. The true facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Bill Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I helped to negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds. Bill says: Hillary was the face of America all over the world. The true facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic, and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them. Bill says: Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues. The true facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 9-11 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton. She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country when it comes to the war on terror: 1. She wants to close GITMO  and  move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system. 2. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA. 3. She wants to grants constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield. 4. She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells  and  supporters in the USA. 5. She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military  and  CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.I can't think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, I can think of a lot of comments she has made that weakens our country and makes it a more dangerous situation for all of us........She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned. She is a disaster for all Americans.", "title": "FrontPage Magazine", "label": "real", "id": 159}
{"message": "Obama addresses key concerns for Floridians Related Links Watch complete interview In an exclusive one-on-one interview this afternoon at the White House, News Channel 8 anchor Keith Cate asked President Barack Obama questions about the economy, health care and Republican leadership. Keith: Let me start with the economy, Mr. President. Unemployment in the state of Florida is higher than the national average. Obama: Right. Keith: 11.9 percent. What does this new tax deal do for those 1.1 million Floridians who are looking for work, and what does it do for the businesses that have been reluctant to hire and maybe in some circumstances, because of the economy, cannot afford to hire? Obama: Well, first of all, you're absolutely right. Florida was as hard hit as any state in the country -- partly because the housing market in Florida really took a hit. And in those states where the housing market went up and then went down very rapidly, that really hurt the economy generally. This tax package does a couple of things immediately for economic growth in Florida. Number one, for those folks looking for work right now, it extends their unemployment benefits. Two million people across the country would lose their unemployment benefits at the end of this month if we did not move forward on this tax agreement. And economists say that not only is that good for those families, it's good for the entire economy. It's probably the biggest boost that we can give an economy because those folks are most likely to spend the money with businesses, and that gives them customers. The second thing it does is make sure that no middle class family's taxes go up starting on Jan. 1. Because the taxes are structured, they were set to expire automatically at the end of this year. Which meant that if Congress does nothing, people's paychecks are smaller. Now that's not going to be good for the economy at a time when people feel pinched -- the notion that somehow they have $1,000, $2,000, $3,000 worth of taxes to pay, that's a big problem. The third thing it does is it reduces payroll taxes for everybody in Florida. Which means that now people have a little more money in their pockets, they're more likely to spend, they're more likely to be confident about the direction of the economy. Fourth, it makes sure that all the business provisions that we had put in place a couple years ago to incentivize investments in clean energy, solar power, wind power -- investments in plants and equipment -- that all those investments, tax credits continue into next year and the year after that. So economists generally estimate whereas they were predicting 2.5 percent growth next year, they think that if this tax package goes through, they think that we may end up having 3.5 or 4 percent growth. And that extra percent of growth could mean an extra 1.5 million jobs throughout the country. That's going to be good for Florida. Keith: What is your relationship with the Republican leadership at this point going forward? A lot of the country looks and goes bipartisanship, but after the agreement was worked out you used the term hostage taker -- you didn't like dealing with hostage takers. Do you still feel that same way? What's your view of the Republican Party today? Obama: The truth of the matter is, I get along fine with Mitch McConnell and I get along fine with John Boehner. On this narrow issue, I disagreed with their approach. My preference would have been to provide all those good things that I just described but not give tax breaks to the top 1, 2 percent. Folks like me that frankly don't need a tax break. I'm not going to change my spending patterns because I get a tax break. If there's something I need, I'm going to buy it. I'm not the person who needs it and who's going to add to our deficit. So I still think that it was the wrong thing to do and it didn't make sense for us to hold up the tax breaks for middle class families because the high-end tax breaks were going to elapse. But that is a philosophical difference I've got with the Republican Party. We're going to keep on arguing about that well into the next couple years -- both on their side and on my side. But I do think this package required me to take some things I didn't like. It requires them to take some things they don't like. They don't really want to, I think, extend unemployment insurance as long as we're extending it or provide college tax credits or child tax credits to people who need them. And that's part of the compromise that we're probably going to have to look at on a whole host of different issues. Keith: Let me get your opinion if I could on high-speed transit. In the state of Florida the federal government is promising or pledging up to $2.5 billion, $2.7 billion to fund a rail line between Tampa and Orlando. Ohio and Wisconsin said we're not into this, so they gave back some of the money and in fact Florida picked up another $342 million. The governor-elect Rick Scott said he's not so sure about a high-speed connection between Tampa and Orlando. What is the argument for that -- if you agree with that -- when Ohio and Wisconsin say it's not such a good idea. Obama: Well look, let's face it. Some of this is wrapped up in politics. This was my idea that we should make sure that states that want to pursue high-speed rail get help from the federal government. Folks who are running against Democrats, a Democratic president, I understand that. If you go to other countries, they are cleaning our clock when it comes to infrastructure. You've got high-speed rail in China that is moving people around in ways that make our rail systems look archaic. They're investing in airports that make our airports look completely outdated. Their ports, their roads. Infrastructure across the board is going in an upward direction while our infrastructure is deteriorating. And that's not my estimation -- that's the estimation of professional engineers. So when you look at, for example, the opportunities of high-speed rail linking together key cities in Florida and historically how the rail systems have been able to promote business and economic growth and greater efficiency and fewer commuter times, it is a good thing not only by putting people to work right away but by fostering economic growth over the long term. This was an idea that has great enthusiasm among local civic leaders in those cities. And my hope is that everybody looks at this objectively and take the politics out of it. If they do, then I think Florida will benefit in part from decisions that were made in Wisconsin and Ohio that I don't think will serve their people well. Keith: Quickly, if I could get your reaction to what took place in Richmond, Va., today. I know you've been asked about this, but I'd like to hear it from you directly  when it comes to the health care decision, that parts of it are unconstitutional. What does that do? Your opinion on health care? What's your reaction to that ruling? Obama: I haven't read the full ruling. I've just gotten a synopsis on it. But keep in mind this is one ruling by one federal district court. We've already had two federal district courts that have ruled that this is definitely constitutional. We've got 12 federal courts who have dismissed similar lawsuits, So the majority of courts who looked at this issue so far are absolutely convinced that the health care bill is [constitutional]. You've got one judge who disagreed. That's the nature of these things. When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the civil rights act was passed and the voting rights act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. We are absolutely confident that the basic issue that this judge identified -- that we say that in order to make sure that insurance companies have to provide care to people with pre-existing conditions, we've got to make sure that everybody has some kind of insurance -- the same way that they have car insurance. That's something that makes sense to most people. Think about it -- when it comes to car insurance, we wouldn't say that you can wait until you get into a car wreck and then you can go to the insurance company, say hey, I want to buy some insurance for my car. If you can't do that for car insurance, why can you do that for health insurance. How can you wait until you get sick and then go and say I want to buy some insurance? That isn't fair and I think most people understand it isn't fair. All we've said is everybody has to get some basic insurance so that we're not paying for you when you get sick. And that helps keep everybody's cost down and it makes sure that that insurance company can't discriminate against you if you've got pre-existing conditions. It's the right thing to do, and I'm confident that the courts will uphold it. Keith: When might you be coming back to the state of Florida? I don't know if you've heard but the beaches are clean and the water is pure. Any thoughts on a business trip or maybe a pleasure trip to the state of Florida? Open for business. Obama: Let me tell you -- if there's any time in January, February or March where I can get to Florida, I'm going to take that opportunity. Because I don't know if you've noticed, but it's a little chilly outside right here. Keith: It is, but it's cold in Florida today.

{"message": "Rose Garden 11:27 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. Lately, Ive been speaking a lot about our need for an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy -- a strategy that produces more oil and gas here at home, but also produces more biofuels and fuel-efficient cars, more solar power and wind power and other sources of clean, renewable energy. This strategy is not just the right thing to do for our long-term economic growth; its also the right way for us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil right now. Its the right way for us to put people to work right now. And ultimately, its the right way to stop spikes in gas prices that weve put up [with] every single year -- the same kind of increase that weve seen over the past couple of months. Obviously rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families. Whether youre trying to get to school, trying to get to work, do some grocery shopping, you have to be able to fill up that gas tank. And there are families in certain parts of the country that have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to the job. So when gas prices go up, its like an additional tax that comes right out of your pocket. Thats one of the reasons we passed a payroll tax cut at the beginning of this year and made sure it extended all the way through this year, so that the average American is getting that extra $40 in every paycheck right now. But I think everybody understands that there are no quick fixes to this problem. There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more then gas prices would come down right away. What they dont say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. Weve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some. But as I've said repeatedly, the problem is we use more than 20 percent of the worlds oil and we only have 2 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves. Even if we drilled every square inch of this country right now, wed still have to rely disproportionately on other countries for their oil. That means we pay more at the pump every time theres instability in the Middle East, or growing demand in countries like China and India. Thats whats happening right now. Its those global trends that are affecting gas prices. So even as we're tackling issues of supply and demand, even as we're looking at the long-term in terms of how we can structurally make ourselves less reliant on foreign oil, we still need to work extra hard to protect consumers from factors that should not affect the price of a barrel of oil. That includes doing everything we can to ensure that an irresponsible few arent able to hurt consumers by illegally manipulating or rigging the energy markets for their own gain. We can't afford a situation where speculators artificially manipulate markets by buying up oil, creating the perception of a shortage, and driving prices higher -- only to flip the oil for a quick profit. We cant afford a situation where some speculators can reap millions, while millions of American families get the short end of the stick. Thats not the way the market should work. And for anyone who thinks this cannot happen, just think back to how Enron traders manipulated the price of electricity to reap huge profits at everybody elses expense. Now, the good news is my administration has already taken several actions to step up oversight of oil markets and close dangerous loopholes that were allowing some traders to operate in the shadows. We closed the so-called Enron loophole that let traders evade oversight by using electronic or overseas trading platforms. In the Wall Street reform law, we said for the first time that federal regulators will make sure no single trader can buy such a large position in oil that they could easily manipulate the market on their own. So Id point out that anybody whos pledging to roll back Wall Street reform -- Dodd-Frank -- would also roll back this vital consumer protection along with it. Ive asked Attorney General Holder to work with Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, Chairman Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other enforcement agencies to make sure that acts of manipulation, fraud or other illegal activity are not behind increases in the price that consumers pay at the pump. So today, were announcing new steps to strengthen oversight of energy markets. Things that we can do administratively, we are doing. And I call on Congress to pass a package of measures to crack down on illegal activity and hold accountable those who manipulate the market for private gain at the expense of millions of working families. And be specific. First, Congress should provide immediate funding to put more cops on the beat to monitor activity in energy markets. This funding would also upgrade technology so that our surveillance and enforcement officers arent hamstrung by older and less sophisticated tools than the ones that traders are using. We should strengthen protections for American consumers, not gut them. And these markets have expanded significantly. Chairman Gensler actually had a good analogy. He said, imagine if the NFL quadrupled the number of teams but didnt increase the number of refs. Youd end up having havoc on the field, and it would diminish the game. It wouldnt be fair. Thats part of whats going on in a lot of these markets. So we have to properly resource enforcement. Second, Congress should increase the civil and criminal penalties for illegal energy market manipulation and other illegal activities. So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold, and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs. Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect against volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades. Congress should do all of this right away. A few weeks ago, Congress had a chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump; congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies. So here's a chance to make amends, a chance to actually do something that will protect consumers by increasing oversight of energy markets. That should be something that everybody, no matter their party, should agree with. And I hope Americans will ask their members of Congress to step up. In the meantime, my administration will take new executive actions to better analyze and investigate trading activities in energy markets and more quickly implement the tough consumer protections under Wall Street reform. Let me close by saying none of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight. But it will prevent market manipulation and make sure we're looking out for American consumers. And in the meantime we're going to keep pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy to break the cycle of price spikes year after year. We are going to keep producing more biofuels; we're going to keep producing more fuel-efficient cars; we are going to keep tapping into every source of American-made energy. And these steps have already helped put America on a path to greater energy independence. Our foreign -- our dependence on foreign oil has actually decreased each year I've been in office -- even as the economy has grown. America now imports less than half of the oil we use for the first time in more than a decade. So we are less vulnerable than we were, but we're still too vulnerable. We've got to continue the hard, sustained work on this issue. And as long as I'm President we're going to keep placing our bets on America's future -- America's workers, America's technology, America's ingenuity, and American-made energy. That's how we're going to solve this problem once and for all. Thank you very much, everybody. END 11:35 A.M.

{"message": "Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace Washington, DC, Aug 1 - In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years. In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not. Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below. August 1, 2013 The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Ave., SW Washington, DC 20201 RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium Rates Dear Secretary Sebelius, It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State. As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now. As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Floridas Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates. Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Floridas Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMSs determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers. Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower. Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Floridas new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable. While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in. The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers  since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.", "title": "Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace", "label": "real", "id": 162}
{"message": "In part five of the second democratic primary debate, things get personal as the candidates touch on the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives In part five of the second democratic primary debate, things get personal as the candidates touch on the Black Lives Matter movement, Hillary Clinton's email scandal and Bernie Sanders' ability to win over conservatives Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earned laughter and applause during Saturday's Democratic debate for a line defending his progressive tax policy. When asked how he would pay for proposals like tuition-free college for Americans, Sanders said he would finance them by \"due-demanding: that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations - have gotten away with murder for years - start paying their fair share.\" CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes pressed the White House hopeful: \"Let's get specific. How high would you go? You've said before you'd go above 50 percent. How high?\" \"We haven't come up with an exact number yet,\" Sanders responded. \"But it will not be as high as the number under Dwight D. Eisenhower which was 90 percent.\" As an aside, he said, to loud cheers in the audience: \"I'm not that much of a socialist compared to Eisenhower.\" Sanders went on to say that his administration would \"end the absurdities as Warren Buffet often reminds us - that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses, or truck drivers that makes no sense at all. There has to be real tax reform and the wealthiest and the large corporations will pay when I'm president.\" In fact, during the first term of Republican President Eisenhower, the marginal tax rate on regular income for those earning over $400,000 -- at the time, the highest income bracket -- was 92 percent. The tax rate was carried over from Democratic President Harry Truman's administration. This was the second-highest tax rate during the 20th century, following the 94 percent instituted by President Roosevelt during World War II for those making over $200,000 annually. In 1954, under Eisenhower, the rate for the highest income bracket decreased to 91 percent. Taking into account these income tax rates, Sanders' assertion that he's not as \"socialist\" as Eisenhower's administration is correct: Sanders has said before that he doesn't believe his tax policy would tax the top bracket over 90 percent, though he has yet to offer up an exact number. Appearing on \"CBS This Morning\" in September, Sanders said \"We are going to ask the wealthiest people in this country who are doing phenomenally well, and many large corporations that are making billions of dollars of profits and not paying a nickel in taxes, to in fact start paying their fair share of taxes.\" When asked to specify, the Vermont senator said of taxing those in the highest income bracket, \"I don't think you have to go up to 90 percent.\" Sanders, however, has also called for greater increases in capital gains taxes, which were capped at 25 percent during most of Eisenhower's tenure. During Saturday's debate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also defended asking the wealthy to pay a higher share of taxes. \"Under Ronald Reagan's first term, the highest marginal rate was 70 percent,\" he pointed out. O'Malley is also correct on this point: Under President Reagan, those with annual incomes over $215,400 were taxed at a rate of 69.1 percent.", "title": "Democratic debate: Bernie Sanders really isn't as \"socialist\" as President Eisenhower", "label": "real", "id": 163}
{"message": "While the ostensible reasons for inflicting pain keep changing, however, the policy prescriptions of the Pain Caucus all have one thing in common: They protect the interests of creditors, no matter the cost. Deficit spending could put the unemployed to work  but it might hurt the interests of existing bondholders. More aggressive action by the Fed could help boost us out of this slump  in fact, even Republican economists have argued that a bit of inflation might be exactly what the doctor ordered  but deflation, not inflation, serves the interests of creditors. And, of course, theres fierce opposition to anything smacking of debt relief. Who are these creditors Im talking about? Not hard-working, thrifty small business owners and workers, although it serves the interests of the big players to pretend that its all about protecting little guys who play by the rules. The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery. No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios. And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, its the class that has personal access to policy makers  many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door. The process of influence doesnt have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too). All it requires is the tendency to assume that whats good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings  hey, theyre rich, theyre smart, and they have great tailors  must be good for the economy as a whole. But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy. This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else.

{"message": "As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. \"One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,\" CNNs Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin OMalley group. \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,\" said the attack, which first aired June 25. \"Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.\" Sanders record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (\"Bernie Sanders, gun nut\") as well as conservative glee (\"Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut\"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.) But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:  In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.  The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didnt muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.  After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didnt exist at the time).  He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.  The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job. \"He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,\" Weaver said. \"He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.\" In April 1991, Sanders then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents. \"Bernies response is that he doesnt just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,\" Pollina said. \"Its not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.\" The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us. \"As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,\" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents preferences so does not make gun control a priority.\" \"I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line  and angering both sides through the years,\" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. \"Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.\" Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half. Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position): Sanders moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesnt consider Sanders \"an anti-gunner,\" and hes received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isnt a \"gun lobby lapdog.\" Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders views are to the right of his Democratic rivals. \"When it comes to guns, hes not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin OMalley or Hillary Clinton,\" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. \"Guns are not an important issue for him, because they dont fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.\" Our ruling An attack ad said, \"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.\" The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks. Experts noted Sanders votes were representative of Vermonts gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.

Dear Friend, What does it take to be the most liberal member of the United States Senate  farther left than Ted Kennedy, John Kerry or even Hillary Clinton? For the answer, take a look at a man who could be the next president of the United States: Barack Obama. Sen. Obama was recently named the most liberal U.S. Senator, based on the annual voting analysis by the non-partisan and highly respected National Journal.1 If he emerges as the Democratic nominee, one of the critical jobs of Focus Action will be to uncover the real Barack Obamanot the feel-good orator who speaks of change and hope, but the man who would be the most left-wing president in our nations history. And well need your continued help to do so. Obama: As extreme as they come on family issues On abortion, Obamas 100 percent lifetime voting record from Planned Parenthood and NARAL only begins to tell the story.2 While in the Illinois State Senate six years ago, Obama was the only senator to speak against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act, which protects babies who are born alive after a failed abortion. In other words, it prevents flat-out infanticide. A year later while the U.S. Senate was passing Born Alive 98-0  state Sen. Obama quietly killed an identical bill in the state committee he chaired! 3 Not surprisingly, then, he also opposes the ban on partial-birth abortion 4, 5 and supports allowing minor girls to be transported across state lines for abortions without parental notice or consent. 6 and supports allowing minor girls to be transported across state lines for abortions without parental notice or consent. Perhaps most chilling is his avowed support for the Freedom of Choice Act, 7 which, if signed into law, would threaten every pro-life law passed at the state and federal levels over the past 30 years. which, if signed into law, would threaten every pro-life law passed at the state and federal levels over the past 30 years. In addition, while the next president could effectively overturn Roe v. Wade with the right Supreme Court appointments, Obama is proudly committed to appointing judges who will uphold legal abortion.8 In fact, his judicial philosophy is typical of the radical left. He believes that judges can change the meaning of the Constitution at their discretion.9 Not surprisingly, he voted against the nominations of Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito. How about marriage and the homosexual agenda? First, he opposes the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). 10 If given the chance by the liberal Congress, Obama will overturn DOMA, potentially forcing every state to recognize homosexual marriages and guaranteeing that you and I pay federal benefits to support homosexual couples. Please note: Technically, he says he is opposed to same-sex marriage, but by standing against DOMA, he is standing against the only thing that prevents same-sex marriages from spreading state to state. If given the chance by the liberal Congress, Obama will overturn DOMA, potentially forcing every state to recognize homosexual marriages and guaranteeing that you and I pay federal benefits to support homosexual couples. Please note: Technically, he says he is opposed to same-sex marriage, but by standing against DOMA, he is standing against the only thing that prevents same-sex marriages from spreading state to state. Second, he has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act 11 (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality). (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality). Then theres his support for teaching schoolchildren (in 2nd grade, no less) about homosexual relationships.12 He also wants to require women to register for the draft.13 And, as a state senator, he even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!14 The price of change: Hold on to your wallet! Sen. Obama talks constantly about the need for change. But what he doesnt tell you is the price tag, so allow me: It will be very expensive change. He supports raising taxes to pay for universal health care, his free college program and a host of other government expansions.15 Among his pet projects is a bill he sponsored called the Global Poverty Act, which would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid. Over 13 years, that will amount to a whopping $845 billion increase over current foreign-aid spending!16 Get your checkbooks ready! National security? One area where Sen. Obama seems to have an aversion to spending is the War on Terror. But its not just the admittedly controversial war in Iraq where Obama has shown himself to be soft on terror: He has repeatedly voted against funding our troops in Iraqunless the funding included a date certain by which our soldiers must withdraw from their fight against al Qaeda. 17 Even with the troop surge producing superb results, Obama has called both the surge and the war a failure. 18, 19 In fact, he and Hillary seem to be in a rhetorical contest to see who can abandon the battlefield first. Even with the troop surge producing superb results, Obama has called both the surge and the war a failure. In fact, he and Hillary seem to be in a rhetorical contest to see who can abandon the battlefield first. He, along with Hillary, voted to give captured terrorists and illegal immigrants constitutional rights that are reserved for American citizens. 20 Can you believe that Sen. Obama actually favors granting citizenship to illegal immigrants convicted of crimes against children, aggravated felonies and other serious crimes? 21 It's true. Can you believe that Sen. Obama actually favors granting citizenship to illegal immigrants convicted of crimes against children, aggravated felonies and other serious crimes? It's true. Perhaps, then, it should come as no surprise that Obama also voted against a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from desecration.22 One has to ask: Did he learn anything from 9/11? Ditto for Hillary? On most of the issues Ive mentioned, Hillary isnt far behind Obamas extremism. In fact, she ranked as the 16th most liberal senator in National Journals scoring.23 But the reality is that most people know about Hillary. They remember her push for government-run health care.24 They know of her radical pro-abortion stance.25 They may even recall her support for allowing young children to sue their parents.26 Obama, though, is the new kid on the block. In fact, a little more than three years ago, he was still an Illinois state senator. Now, the media is fawning over him  and isnt about to delve into his leftist record.

{"message": "With Americans demanding a new way forward in Washington, House Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) uses the Weekly Republican Address to outline solutions for ending economic uncertainty, stopping governments spending binge, and changing the way Congress does business. In the address, Boehner notes that this is a new approach that hasnt been tried in Washington  by either party  and it is at the core of the Pledge to America, a governing agenda Republicans built by listening to the people. Leader Boehner recorded the weekly address earlier this week from Ohio, where he ran a small business and saw first-hand how Washington can make it harder for employers and entrepreneurs to meet a payroll and create jobs. Following is a transcript of Boehners remarks. Audio of the Weekly Republican Address is available now here. The video will be available here for viewing and here for downloading. Hello. Im John Boehner. Before I served in Congress, I ran a small business here in Ohio, and I saw first-hand how politicians in Washington can make it harder for small employers to meet a payroll and create jobs. In the final days of the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama promised to change this country and change the world. Well I dont know about the world, but here at home, Americans havent experienced the change President Obama promised. One in ten of our fellow citizens is out of work. Our national debt has grown by $3 trillion Trust in government has fallen to an all-time low. These problems didnt start under President Obama. But instead of fixing them, his policies have made them worse. A stimulus spending spree that created jobs in China and El Salvador, while millions of Americans lost their jobs here. A job-killing national energy tax. A government takeover of health care. All these things have combined to create massive uncertainty for small businesses, the engine of job creation in America, while our children face a future clouded by debt. Americans are demanding a new way forward in Washington  an approach that neither party has tried. It starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it; making government smaller and more accountable; and helping small businesses get back to creating jobs again. Thats what Republicans are offering with our Pledge to America, a governing agenda built by listening to the people. A generation of fiscal recklessness in Washington has pushed us to the brink. Just to stay afloat, were now borrowing 41 cents of every dollars we spend from our kids and grandkids. This spending spree threatens our childrens future. Its also hurting our economy. Americans know it has to stop, and our Pledge to America puts forth a plan to do just that. Were ready to cut spending to pre-stimulus, pre-bailout levels, saving taxpayers $100 billion almost immediately. And were ready to put in place strict budget caps that limit spending from here on out, to ensure that Washington is no longer on this spending binge. We need to stop the coming tax hike. We cant balance the budget without cutting spending and achieving real economic growth  and we wont have real economic growth if we raise taxes on small businesses and families. Theres a third thing we need to do to help our economy, and thats change Congress itself. The American people are in charge of this country, and they deserve a Congress that acts like it. Americans should have three days to read all bills before Congress votes on them  something they didnt get when the stimulus was rushed into law. We should put an end to so-called comprehensive bills that make it easy to hide wasteful spending projects and job-killing policies. Bills should be written by legislators in committee in plain public view  not written in the Speakers office, behind closed doors. Across our nation, Americans are looking at President Obamas policies and asking  where are the jobs? To help our economy get back on track, we have to stop all of the coming tax hikes and cut spending  and to cut spending, we need to change Congress itself. This is a new way forward that hasnt been tried in Washington yet. Its a break from the direction in which President Obama has taken our country. And frankly, its also a break from the direction in which Republicans were headed when Americans last entrusted us with the reins of government. The American people are in charge, and they deserve nothing less. Together, we can do these things. And in doing so, we can begin the drive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable government that honors our Constitution and respects the will of the people. These ideas are at the core of our Pledge to America. Weve tried it President Obamas way. Weve tried it Washingtons way. It hasnt worked. Its time to put the people back in charge.

A transitional force of about 50,000 troops will remain, though. Earlier this week, President Obama spelled out their mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: Our forces will have a focused mission -- supporting and training Iraqi forces; partnering with Iraqis in counter-terrorism missions, and protecting our civilian and military efforts. But make no mistake: Our commitment in Iraq is changing from a military effort led by our troops to a civilian effort led by our diplomats. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR: But five months after elections, Iraqi politicians have not yet formed a government, and violence continues. Last night, three explosions at a market in southern Iraq killed dozens of people. And today, two car bombs went off west of Baghdad. Joining me this morning from Baghdad, the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, General Ray Odierno. General Odierno, thank you very much for joining us on \"This Week.\" And I want to start by asking you about the handover. You have just handed over all combat operations to Iraqi forces. Are they really ready to stand up once you draw down by the end of this month? ODIERNO: Well, this is something that we've been working for a very long time with the Iraqi security forces. For the last 20 months, we've been slowly and deliberately turning over more and more responsibility to them, and they have stepped up. They continue to do broad-scoped operations across all of Iraq. We continue to help them as they do these, and that will continue after 1 September, our assistance. But we do believe they are ready to assume full operations in Iraq. AMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you about the violence. This weekend alone in Basra in the south, there has been a big explosion that's caused dozens of deaths. What is it? Do you know what it is, in fact, was it a terrorist attack? ODIERNO: Well, I think it probably was. We're still sorting through that, because there was conflicting reports, but my guess is it was probably some sort of an improvised explosive device that went off. I would just say, this is a reflection -- we have ups and downs here. As I step back, having been here since the dark days of 2006 and '7, to where we are today, what I see is a broad change in the security environment here in Iraq. However, there are still groups out there who are conducting terrorist acts against the people of Iraq, and they are doing this to stop the political way forward, to stop the political process moving forward, to stop democracy moving forward, and to cause the government of Iraq not to continue its progress. And that's what we're seeing that's playing out on the ground now. AMANPOUR: Well, General Odierno, in fact, it seems that the political parties in Iraq are not moving forward with the democracy as you describe it. Five months or more after the election, there is still no government. How much does that worry you, and what kind of vacuum is that creating there? ODIERNO: Well, again, first off, we've seen during this time, this governmental formation timeframe, the Iraqi security forces have acted neutral; they've continued to conduct operations across the broad spectrum of operations that are necessary. In fact, I have found them to be very professional in continuing to execute the security profile. So we have seen no degradation in their ability to execute the security profile. And I think that's actually an extremely positive step forward for them, that they've continued to operate, even though -- or during this time of governmental formation. AMANPOUR: So, how concerned are you and at what point will you be concerned if there is no government, and do you think that that is providing space for insurgents to reorganize, as many suggest? ODIERNO: Well, I will just tell you, is what we -- again, what we can't do is overreact to incidents. There are going to be incidents that occur here. There is a level of violence and a level of terrorism here that's going to occur. But I will tell you, over the last six to seven months, the success that we've had against Al Qaida in Iraq specifically in decapitating the leadership has in fact affected them. The kind of operations that they now conduct are very different than what they did just six months ago or eight months ago. And the kind of their ability to surge and do this over a sustained period of time is limited, and that's due to a lot of the work of the Iraqi security forces, working with us to conduct these operations.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Odierno and Chiarelli", "label": "real", "id": 173}
{"message": "UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has welcomed news of the arrival in the United States this week of the 10,000th refugee from the conflict in Syria, and calls for greater global solidarity ahead of summits next month that will look at ways to increase efforts to deal with the unprecedented refugee crisis worldwide. The United States has long been a leader in welcoming people fleeing global persecution and the arrival on Monday of the 10,000th Syrian refugee is a further expression of this leadership, said UNHCR Regional Representative in the United States, Shelly Pitterman. We thank the communities in the United States that have kept their doors open and also our civil society partners for their tireless humanitarian efforts. Much more needs to be done for Syrian refugees and for the global crisis that has seen more people flee persecution than at any time ever recorded. At the end of 2015, war, conflict and persecution had forced 65.3 million people globally to flee for their lives, an all-time high. The Syrian refugee crisis is the worlds largest and more than 4.8 million have fled mostly to neighbouring countries whose resources are stretched thin so that increasing numbers of refugees live below national poverty lines. To aid the most vulnerable refugees and to share the tremendous burden of these refugee-hosting countries, UNHCR has called on governments to resettle those most at risk. So far resettlement countries have pledged a total of more than 220,000 places for Syrians under resettlement and other humanitarian admissions programmes. Around 478,000 Syrians are considered to be in need of resettlement  close to 40 per cent of the 1.19 million people who are in need of resettlement globally. UNHCR recognizes that opportunities for resettlement are extremely limited and so reserves this for persons who are most at risk, such as unaccompanied children, women-headed households, victims of torture, and persons with special medical needs. UNHCR identifies and carefully screens all refugees before they are referred to a country for resettlement. In the case of the United States, all refugees who are referred then undergo extensive face-to-face interviews with Department of Homeland Security officers, along with multiple layers of identity and security checks in a thorough process undertaken by US authorities. UNHCR calls for increased efforts to provide Syrian refugees with additional safe and regular pathways for admission. The United Nations General Assembly Summit for Refugees and Migrants on 19 September and the President of the United States Summit on Refugees on 20 September will provide opportunities for countries to show solidarity with refugee-hosting countries across the globe by giving Syrian and other vulnerable refugee groups legal opportunities to access safety and protection through resettlement and other pathways for admission. Resettling refugees, along with continued humanitarian funding, is a critical form of solidarity with refugee-hosting countries and it needs to be expanded worldwide, said Pitterman.", "title": "UN Refugee Agency welcomes arrival of 10,000th Syrian refugee resettled to United States", "label": "real", "id": 174}

Turn on your TV and youll see some self-satisfied pundit declaring that nothing much can be done about the economys short-run problems (reminder: this short run is now in its fourth year), that we should focus on the long run instead.

{"message": "SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMIC TRENDS Small Business Optimism Index decreased 0.8 points in March to 90.1, marking the 15th consecutive month below the 49-year average of 98. Twenty-four percent of owners reported inflation as their single most important business problem, down four points from last month. Small business owners expecting better business conditions over the next six months remain at a net negative 47%. Small business owners are cynical about future economic conditions, said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. Hiring plans fell to their lowest level since May 2020, but strong consumer spending has kept Main Street alive and supported strong labor demand. Key findings include:  Forty-three percent of owners reported job openings that were hard to fill, down four points from February and remaining historically very high.  The net percent of owners raising average selling prices decreased one point to a net 37% seasonally adjusted.  The net percent of owners who expect real sales to be higher deteriorated six points from February to a net negative 15%. As reported in NFIBs monthly jobs report, a seasonally adjusted net 15% of owners are planning to create new jobs in the next three months. Twenty-six percent of owners reported few qualified applicants for their open positions and 27% reported none. Eleven percent of owners cited labor costs as their top business problem and 23% said that labor quality was their top business problem. Labor quality remains in second place behind inflation by one point as the top business problem. Fifty-seven percent of owners reported capital outlays in the next six months, down three points from February. Of those making expenditures, 40% reported spending on new equipment, 23% acquired vehicles, and 11% spent money for new fixtures and furniture. Fifteen percent improved or expanded facilities and 6% acquired new buildings or land for expansion. Twenty percent of owners are planning capital outlays in the next few months, down one point from February. Overall, the small business sector shows little strength from capital spending. A net negative 6% of all owners (seasonally adjusted) reported higher nominal sales in the past three months. Sales are trending down. The net percent of owners expecting higher real sales volumes deteriorated six points to a net negative 15%. The net percent of owners reporting inventory increases was unchanged at a net negative 1%. Not seasonally adjusted, thirteen percent reported increases in stocks and 17% reported reductions. Nineteen percent of owners reported that supply chain disruptions still have a significant impact on their business. Another 31% reported a moderate impact and 35% reported a mild impact. A net 1% of owners viewed current inventory stocks as too low in March, up five points from February. By industry, shortages are reported most frequently in transportation (18%), retail (17%), manufacturing (16%), and wholesale (16%). Complaints of shortages in construction (3%) have been reduced because home sales have slowed due to higher interest rates. A net negative 4% of owners plan inventory investment in the coming months, up three points from February. The net percent of owners raising average selling prices decreased one point from February to a net 37% seasonally adjusted, the lowest since April 2021. Unadjusted, 11% reported lower average selling prices and 50% reported higher average prices. Price hikes were the most frequent in wholesale (71% higher, 16% lower), retail (61% higher, 8% lower), construction (57% higher, 8% lower), and finance (56% higher, 8% lower). Seasonally adjusted, a net 26% plan price hikes, up one point. Seasonally adjusted, a net 42% reported raising compensation, down six points from February. A net 22% plan to raise compensation in the next three months. The frequency of positive profit trends was a net negative 18%, five points better than in February. Among owners reporting lower profits, 31% blamed weaker sales, 23% blamed the rise in the cost of materials, 13% cited the usual seasonal change, 9% cited lower prices, 8% cited labor costs, and 3% cited higher taxes or regulatory costs. For owners reporting higher profits, 48% credited sales volumes, 21% cited higher prices, 18% cited usual seasonal change, and 5% cited lower labor costs. Two percent of owners reported that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied. Twenty-nine percent reported all credit needs were met and 59% said they were not interested in a loan. A net 9% reported their last loan was harder to get than in previous attempts, up four points. Three percent reported that financing was their top business problem. A net 26% of owners reported paying a higher rate on their most recent loan, up two points. Rates are rising, but credit is still available.", "title": "NFIB", "label": "real", "id": 177}
{"message": "McCain renews attacks on Obama links to radical MIAMI, Florida (AFP)  Republican John McCain renewed his attacks on Barack Obama's ties to a 1960s radical here Wednesday as he targeted voters in the key battleground state of Florida. McCain, who has refrained from linking Obama to Bill Ayers during recent campaign speeches, went back on the offensive six days before the November 4 polls in an interview with a Spanish-language radio station in Miami. \"I think this whole issue of the relationship with Bill Ayers needs to be known by the American people,\" he told Radio Mambi. \"Senator Obama said it was just a guy in the neighborhood. We know much more than that.\" Ayers was a member of the \"Weathermen\" movement, classified by the FBI as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" which carried out a series of attacks to protest the Vietnam War, including on the Pentagon and US Capitol. Obama met Ayers early in his political career in 1995 but his campaign has said he has not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages with him since Obama became US senator in 2005. McCain went on to accuse the Los Angeles Times of refusing to publish a video it had obtained of Ayers attending an event with a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). \"I don't care much about an old, washed-up unrepentant terrorist, and his wife who was on an FBI top 10 wanted list,\" McCain said. \"But we should know about their relationship, including apparently information that is held by the Los Angeles Times concerning an event that Mr Ayers attended with a PLO spokesman.\" McCain appeared to be referring to a Los Angeles Times article from April which said Obama knew and attended a farewell party for Rashid Khalidi, a former PLO spokesman, during his academic career in Chicago. The article makes no mention of Ayers's presence at the event. \"The Los Angeles Times refuses to make that videotape public. I'm not in the business of talking about media bias but what if there was a tape with John McCain with a neo-Nazi outfit being held by some media outlet? \"I think the treatment of the issue would be slightly different,\" he said, saying Ayers had a \"long relationship\" with Obama, who was eight years old when the Weathermen were waging their radical campaign. \"It's not that Barack Obama was eight years old when Mr Ayers was committing acts of terror, it's all about the long relationship on foundations, for his book and launching his political career in Mr Ayers living room,\" McCain said. The interview was one of several given by the 72-year-old senator to local radio in Miami as he attempts to woo the influential Hispanic vote in Florida , a state he almost certainly must win in order to take the White House. Later McCain took aim at recent comments by former Cuba president Fidel Castro, who had ridiculed the former pilot's low grades at naval academy. \"I notice in the past couple of days that Fidel has made his preferences known in the campaign and had some very unkind things to say about me,\" McCain said. \"My feelings are hurt.\" More than one million Cuban-Americans live in Florida, and McCain said he was acutely aware of the group's possible influence in the election race. He attempted to tap into anti-Castro sentiment by vowing to \"restore freedom and democracy\" on the island, criticizing Obama for advocating a policy of diplomatic engagement. \"I think we all know that the Cuban-American vote can be vital to whether I win Florida or not,\" McCain said. \"So I do want to say again that we will never waver in our mission to restore freedom and democracy.", "title": "AFP: McCain renews attacks on Obama links to radical", "label": "real", "id": 178}

Margaret was looking for quarters in her pencil drawer. Mr. Duncan said he understood the unusual circumstances. Theres going to be this extraordinary influx of resources, he said in an interview. So people say, Youre going to be the most powerful secretary ever, but I have no interest in that. Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better. Mr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement  islands of excellence, he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs. The stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nations largest teachers union.

{"message": "A fact sheet on Senator Obama's plan to protect consumers is available HERE Remarks of Senator Barack Obama Credit Cards Event Wednesday, June 11, 2008 Chicago, Illinois Before we begin, I just wanted to say a word about the flooding devastating so many communities. We were scheduled to be holding this event in Iowa, but we decided to cancel it because we didn't want to divert state resources from going to help with flood relief. My heart goes out to the families in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois and across the Midwest, who have been forced to flee their own homes, and leave their businesses and communities behind. Right now, many of them are wondering when they'll be able to return, and what they'll find when they get there. Well, we cannot assure them that their communities will be rebuilt overnight, but we can assure them that they will be rebuilt  because we'll work to ensure that the full resources of our state and federal government are there to help. And I will do everything in my power to see to it that those resources get to the people who need them as swiftly as possible. You know, over the next two weeks, I'm going to be talking a lot about what we can do to build an economy that works for all Americans. Because for families all across this country, our economy hasn't been working for quite some time. I've met Americans who are doing everything right  who are working that extra shift, or taking on that extra job  but are still struggling just to make ends meet. And a big part of the reason is that they're paying $4 a gallon for gas, and skyrocketing costs for groceries, health care, and college tuition  at a time when their wages have stayed the same. As a result, many of them are falling deeper and deeper into debt, and a lot of that debt is being put onto credit cards. Over the past 15 years, average household credit card debt has tripled. The typical family is now nearly $10,000 in the red. And bankruptcy rates have steadily climbed over the past year. Now, let's be honest. Part of why our debt crisis is so bad is that some folks are making reckless decisions  racking up big credit card bills by purchasing flat-screen TVs and other luxury goods that they know they can't afford. And they should have to face the consequences of those decisions. But many more Americans aren't falling into debt because they made an irresponsible decision; they're falling into debt because credit card companies are pushing them over the edge. For too long, credit card companies have been using unfair and deceptive practices to trick Americans into signing agreements they can't afford. The contracts you sign when you get a card have gone from being one page-long a few decades ago to more than thirty pages-long today. And they're often filled with traps and fine print that only a credit card executive could understand. These companies have been crossing the line to boost their bottom line. But rather than stop this outrage, Washington has let them get away with it. And it's no wonder  because the credit card companies have spent millions in recent years financing political campaigns and lobbying Congress to get laws written to their liking. In the first quarter of this year alone, one such industry group spent nearly $800,000 on lobbying. This has to stop. We cannot let the rules of the game continue to be rigged against ordinary Americans. We need a President who will look out for the interests of hardworking families, not just their big campaign donors and corporate allies. And that will be a real difference in this election, because when it comes to Washington letting credit card companies get away with all this, John McCain has been part of the problem. When he had the chance to help families avoid falling into debt, John McCain sided with the credit card companies. When he had the chance to protect teenagers and college students from deceptive credit card practices, he sided with the credit card companies. And when I fought against the credit card industry's bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt, he supported it  and he even opposed exempting families who were only in bankruptcy because of medical expenses they couldn't pay. Just look at the proposals he's been making on this campaign. He's calling for nearly $2 trillion in corporate tax cuts over the next decade, but he hasn't even proposed a single measure to protect hardworking Americans from credit card companies that are trying to take advantage of them. Well, that's not the kind of change that the folks I've met are looking for. They're looking for a President who will fight for them, and restore fairness to our economy. That's the kind of President I'll be. I'll put a middle class tax cut into the pockets of hardworking families  a tax cut that will give 95% of all families $1,000 in relief. I'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 a year. And I'll protect the rights of ordinary Americans by cracking down on companies that are trying to deceive them. That's why back in November, I proposed a plan to help ensure that credit cards don't become the next subprime crisis. It starts with making sure that we have a system that's open and transparent. To help you understand the risks that are involved in signing up for a credit card, I'll create a five-star rating system. That way, Americans can compare credit card companies and avoid those that are stacking the deck against them. Now, don't get me wrong. We all have a responsibility to pay what we owe. But we have to ensure that the amount we're paying is fair. That's why I've proposed a Credit Card Bill of Rights. The first thing we'll do under this bill of rights is ban unilateral changes to credit card agreements. You should pay the rate you signed up for. If the credit card company wants to raise that rate, you should be able to opt out of the agreement. Second, we'll ban rate changes on past debt. If a credit card company wants to raise interest rates, then that new, higher rate should apply to the debt you add going forward, not what you already owe. The store can't change the price of what you bought after you bought it and neither should your credit card. Third, we'll ban interest on transaction fees. If you're late in making a payment, you have to pay a late fee. But you shouldn't be paying a fee for paying a fee. It's time Washington established some rules of the road to level the playing field for hardworking families. It's time we had an economy that worked for companies and consumers alike. That's what my campaign is all about. So the American people will have a clear choice in November: you can choose an approach that sides with the credit card companies when it really counts; or you can choose to finally have a President who looks out for Main Street, not just Wall Street; a President who fights each day to put the American dream within reach for all Americans. And that's the kind of President I intend to be. Thank you.", "title": "by Mark Halperin", "label": "real", "id": 182}

{"message": "Fact Check: Hillarys Iowa Remarks After months of character attacks from her opponents, Hillary responded with the facts. The following is a rundown of some of the contrasts that Hillary highlighted in her speech today in Iowa: Hillary: A couple of my leading opponents, directly and through surrogates, have spent months criticizing me without having to answer any of their own questions. Theyve been attacking my character. As I have said repeatedly, I prefer to attack the problems of the country and let my opponents run their own campaigns. Sen. Obama attacked Hillary. [Fact Hub, 12/3/07] Sen. Edwards criticized Hillary for using doubletalk in the debate. \"The Democratic debate on Tuesday was a defining moment in this election. From my perspective it is important for the next president of the United States to be honest and sincere and trust-worthy given what's happened with Bush over the last seven years. Instead of straight talk, there was a lot of doubletalk in the debate from Senator Clinton on some of the most important issues facing the American people.\" [Edwards Statement, 11/3/07] Hillary: When it comes to health care, one of my opponents believes its acceptable to leave out 15 million Americans. That would be 100,000 here in Iowa. Leave them out from his health care plan because universal coverage might be too hard to achieve. I disagree. I dont think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans. Thats why my health care plan covers everyone. Sen. Obamas health care plan would leave 15 million uninsured. [Fact Hub, 11/19/07] Hillary: When it comes to social security, one of my opponents uses the Republican talking points and has been open to raising the retirement age and cutting benefits. Now he says he is for lifting the payroll tax, which would be a trillion dollar tax increase. Again, I disagree. I dont think we should fix Social Security on the backs of our seniors and the middle class. I have always fought for Social Security, I have always stood up against privatization and as president, I will restore fiscal responsibility so we can keep Social Security as a sacred promise to our seniors. Sen. Obama refused to rule out raising the retirement age and cutting benefits for social security. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07] Sen. Obama conceded that his plan on raising the cap for social security could impact middle income people. Sen. Obama said, Well, when II am going to be listening to any ideas that are presented, but I think that the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax. When pressed on how he would structure the tax increase, Well, ityou know, I have not specified exactly how we would structure it. Conceivably, you might have the equivalent of a doughnut hole, although this one would be a good one, as opposed to the bad doughnut hole that Bush set up for, for prescription drugs where you have a gap between people who are of middle income and very wealthy people. [Meet the Press, 11/11/07] Hillary: When it comes to Iran, I took a stand for aggressive diplomacy. One of my opponents made a different choice: He didnt show up for the vote. He didnt speak out during a presidential debate that night. And finally, he decided to play politics and claim that the vote he missed  a vote for diplomacy  was really a vote for war. Well if he really thought it was a rush to war, why did he rush to campaign and miss the vote? Sen. Obama missed vote, and failed to speak out during a presidential debate. [Fact Hub, 11/20/07] Sen. Obama criticized Hillary for voting to give George Bush the green light for Iran. Sen. Obama wrote, Even worse, the Bush administration could use the language in Lieberman-Kyl to justify an attack on Iran as a part of the ongoing war in IraqI strongly differ with Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was the only Democratic presidential candidate to support this reckless amendment. [New Hampshire Union Leader, 10/11/07] Hillary: Now, theres been a lot of talk about yes or no answers to complex questions. But most people dont know that for legislators who dont want to take a stand, theres a third way to vote. Not yes, not no, but present  which is kind of like voting maybe. Well, in the Illinois State Senate, on issue after issue, my opponent voted present, instead of yes or no. Seven of those votes were on a womens right to choose. Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violenceone of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds. As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on seven abortion bills, including a ban on 'partial birth abortion,' two parental notification laws and three 'born alive' bills. [HB382, Passed 49-3-4, 5/13/1997; SB230, Passed, 44-7-5, 3/18/1997; HB1900, Passed 38-10-9, 5/16/2001; SB562, Passed 39-7-11, 4/6/2001; SB1093, Passed 34-6-12, 3/30/2001; SB1094, Passed 33-6-13, 3/30/2001; SB1095, Passed 34-5-13, 3/30/2001] As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would increase penalties for the use of a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school: The bill called for the mandatory adult persecution of a minor at least 15 years of age being tried for using a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school. [SB759, Passed 52-1-5, 3/25/1999] As a state senator, Sen. Obama voted 'present' on a bill that would reduce the penalty for carrying a concealed weapon from a felony to a misdemeanor. [Concurrence in House Amendments 1 and 2 to SB71, Passed 36-14-9, 5/21/1997] Hillary: A president cant vote present. A president cant pick and choose which challenges he or she will face. My opponents campaign said that voting present was a strategy to provide political cover. The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass. Well, instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass, we need a president who will take a stand. And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country. Chicago Tribune: Sen. Obamas explanation for 'present' votes is questionable; 'few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy' as Sen. Obama did. Sen. Obama \"said he worked out an arrangement with abortion-rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote present on some bills if they feared a no would look insensitive and endanger their re-election. But few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy. And, like Obama, they weren't politically vulnerable.\" [Chicago Tribune, 05/03/07]", "title": "The Fact Hub", "label": "real", "id": 193}

{"message": "For Immediate Release July 15, 2008 Contact: Press Office 703-650-5550 John McCain's Comprehensive Strategy for Victory in Afghanistan Today, John McCain Outlined A New Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan. The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable, and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office, he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan. John McCain Is Calling For A New Strategy In Afghanistan That Applies The Tried And True Principles Of Counter-Insurgency Used In The Iraq Surge. As President, John McCain will turn around the war in Afghanistan with a comprehensive strategy for victory. In Afghanistan, we need an integrated, nationwide civil-military campaign that is focused on providing security for the population. John McCain's Comprehensive Strategy For Victory In Afghanistan: John McCain Will Work With Our Allies To Ensure Unity Of Command In Afghanistan. One of the reasons there is no comprehensive campaign plan for Afghanistan is because there is no unity of command. Today, there are no less than three different American military combatant commands operating in Afghanistan, as well as NATO. The top commander in Afghanistan needs to be just that: the supreme commander of all coalition forces operating a successful counter-insurgency strategy that integrates all instructs of our national power. John McCain Will Appoint An Afghanistan Czar To Ensure Commanders Have What They Need To Win. Unity of command is a principle lacking in Washington. Too often, even as our soldiers and diplomats cooperate in the field, their superiors back home have been squabbling. Last year, the Administration took a step in the right direction and appointed a war czar. But the situation in Afghanistan demands a separate Czar based in the White House, reporting directly to the President and dedicated to the sole mission of ensuring we bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful end. John McCain Supports Sending At Least Three Additional Brigades To Afghanistan. Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops, and thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available, and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them. John McCain Will Double The Size Of The Afghan Military. The Afghan army is already a great success story: a multiethnic, battle-tested fighting force. Yet, it's too small, with a projected strength of only 80,000 troops. We need to at least double the size of the Afghan army to 160,000 troops. To pay for this increase, the international community should share the costs. The United States and our allies should establish an international trust fund to provide long-term financing for the Afghan army. John McCain Will Increase Our Non-Military Assistance To The Afghan Government. Through a multi-front plan, we will increase assistance to the Afghan government to strengthen its institutions, the rule of law, and the economy. Essential to success of the mission in Afghanistan is getting control of narcotics trafficking. Alternative crops must be able to get to market and traffickers must be arrested and prosecuted by enhanced Special Courts. We should agree on specific governance and development benchmarks with the Afghan government and then work with them closely to ensure they are met. John McCain Will Enhance Our Regional Diplomatic Efforts By Appointing A Special Presidential Envoy. The violence in Afghanistan has many causes, but chief among them is the fact that the country is treated by some regional powers as a chessboard to pursue their own ambitions. John McCain will appoint a special presidential envoy to address disputes between Afghanistan and its neighbors. Our goal must be to turn Afghanistan from a theater for regional rivalries into a commons for regional cooperation. As Part Of This Regional Strategy, John McCain Will Put Special Focus On Pakistan. We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there. We must also empower the new civilian government of Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development, health, and education. ###", "title": "John McCain for President", "label": "real", "id": 197}

We can do better. We must embrace our Founders intentions that we evolve our democracy to remain true to its founding principles. Lincoln, 140 years ago, defined our government: of the People, by the People, and for the People. It falls to us to now give full meaning to a Government by the People so our common wisdom is reflected in our national policies. Todays advances in information and communication technology provide us unprecedented ability to communicate as citizens, and all that is lacking is a political process, a mechanism, that permits the citizens to play a direct role in the operations of government. Our country needs a renewalrenewal not just of particular policies, or of particular people, but of democracy itself. I believe that the remedy for the state of our political alienation is the civic renewal embodied in the National Initiative for Democracy. The National Initiative is proposed legislation that colleagues and I have developed over the last fifteen years. The National Initiativewhen enacted into lawwill bring all American citizens into the operations of government as lawmakers. Our three branches of government have become like an unstable chair with only three legs. The Founders could not have envisioned how much money and special interests would corrupt our political process. Giving usAmerican citizenslegislative power will put the fourth leg on our chair, giving birth to a new foundation of American governanceadding a new check to our system of Checks and Balances. I believe the internet adage: all of us together are smarter than any one of us alone. I say: Let the People Decide. Lawmaking is the central power of government not Election Day voting. Politicians have purposely made the electoral process uncompetitive and jealously guard their monopoly on lawmaking. Whoever makes the laws determines who we vote for, when we vote and how we voteFlorida and Ohio are recent examples. Representative government is mired in a culture of lies and corruption. The corrupting influence of money has created a class of professional politicians raising huge sums to maintain power. Then politicians legislate in the interests of corporations and interest groups. Are todays political leaders more corrupt than earlier generations? I do not think so. Most men and women in public service begin with a dedication to the public good. Its the power that corrupts them. Throwing the rascals out Republicans or Democrats or any party for that mattermay make us feel good but reshuffling the deck wont make any difference. We hope against hope that our representatives will correct and reform government. But its like asking the foxes to redesign the chicken-coop. The flaws of representative government arent in either in the structure of representative government or with those who manage it. Its both. Its the structure of representative government that makes its managers susceptible to corruption, greed, injustice and self serving interests.

Our political and economic achievements inspired respect and admiration worldwide. That respect and admiration has been squandered by our current partisan, political leadership. Today, the United States government and the president are reviled in many parts of the world. Not only have we failed as a world leader but our domestic stewardship has presided over a crumbling national infrastructure and unmet social needs while undermining the soundness of our economy with government profligacy. Unfortunately, the partisan, political rhetoric we hear as we approach the 2006 election ineffectively nibbles at the margins of domestic issues and defers submissively to an imperial presidency on global matters. Unfortunately, the monopoly power representatives have thwarts any possibly of reforming government. Representative government, by its very structure, is susceptible to corruption, greed, unfairness, injustice and self-serving special interests. There are only two venues in human governance within which change is possible: the people or the government (that the people set up in the Constitution). Since the government venue is responsible for our current predicament, we have no choice but to look to the venue of the people to reform the government. We need to change the direction of the United States if we are to meet the social, technological, environmental and global challenges of the 21st Century.", "title": "Mike Gravel 2008", "label": "real", "id": 198}

The Libyan government is condemningwhat it called, quote, \"a direct operation to assassinate MoammarGadhafi,\" this after a NATO bomb hit Gadhafi's compound.

Christian, let's start with you. Is there a feeling now that thewar is entering a new phase around Tripoli? FRASER: I think that's a very real possibility, Christiane. Theway that the press visit to this bomb site was orchestrated lastnight, it was very deliberately held back for two hours, and then wewere taken there and then given a press conference here at the hotel,in which Moussa Ibrahim spelled out what he thought the attack meantdoes suggest that they will try and make as much political capitalfrom this as they can. Certainly, it puts pressure on NATO and its allies. And we'veseen already a very angry reaction from his supporters in Tripoli,reports of attacks on the U.S. embassy. I've spoken to U.N. officialstoday who say their offices were looted, also reports of attacks onthe British and Italian missions here in Tripoli. The unknowns, of course, are what Colonel Gadhafi's response willbe. We've not heard from him yet. We don't know what the response ofhis supporters will be in the days ahead, and we don't know, really,what the sort of international reaction will be to what has unfoldedhere last night. AMANPOUR: A lot of questions there, Christian, and we'llcontinue to monitor it.

{"message": "I recently completed a very short interview on Vatican Radio to discuss the current battle between the Obama administration and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. It didnt permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so Id like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place. As Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the Novembers presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year. But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand. Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees  and thereby being fined by the government  or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil. A journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street. What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of womens health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions? Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about. If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; its redefining what the word health means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons, regardless of who pays for the services. This makes it much more than a religious freedom or a conscience issue and a matter of simple justice. More generally, the whole Obamacare mess is a result of employer-provided health insurance. We would all be better off if our health insurance was decoupled from our employment, and we were free to purchase our own insurance according to our needs and wants. It is a result of state intervention in the economy, namely wage-and-price controls, that led to employers offering health insurance as a non-wage benefit to entice desired employees to their companies. Now we have the government mandating that all employers must provide comprehensive coverage to all their employees. What was once a prudential individual decision has become a government-mandated right that trumps the employer-employee, the doctor-patient, and perhaps even the priest-penitent relationship. Some progress. There is some tragic irony to all this. We should not forget that many religious leaders have long-supported increasing the role of the state in health care and the economy at-large, perhaps thinking that conscience clauses would protect their institutions against any undue interference. Well, they were wrong; what the state giveth, the state taketh away. If you invite the state to assist more and more of your activities, it will eventually start telling you how to do things. Encouraging the Democratic Partys efforts from Harry Truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the United States is likely to have dire consequences for Catholic and other religious-based social service providers. Economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works.", "title": "Obamacare vs. the Catholic bishops", "label": "real", "id": 203}
{"message": "Joint DHS and ODNI Election Security Statement Friday, October 07, 2016 DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE WASHINGTON, DC 20511 October 07, 2016 Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscowthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber hygiene scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.", "title": "Joint DHS and ODNI Election Security Statement", "label": "real", "id": 204}

{"message": "WASHINGTON  U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today spoke on the Senate floor in support of religious freedom. Flake invoked the nomination of Professor Amy Barrett, whose nomination to the federal bench has grown contentious due to insinuations on the part of Democrats and special-interest groups that her Catholic faith would affect her ability to be a judge. It is no better for Democrats to evaluate a judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a congressman for the Quran on which he does the same. To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would disregard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrinewhen she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would notis as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow be forced to follow sharia law over the Constitution. Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question. When Barretts religion came up in her confirmation hearing, Flake was quick to argue that line of questioning was both inappropriate and bordered on a religious test. To view Flake and Barretts exchange at the hearing, click here. Following the speech, Flake voted to confirm Barrett to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 55-43. To view Flakes speech, click here. A transcript of the prepared remarks can be viewed below. Background: On Oct. 2, Flake spoke on the Senate floor to warn against a religious test for judicial nominees. To view a video and transcript of Flakes remarks, click here. *** I rise today again to discuss the matter of religious liberty. In particular, I would like to continue to urge this body to respect our Constitutional values and avoid any hint of applying religious tests to those who heed the call of government service. Freedom of religion is as foundational a principle as we have in this country, yet some in this chamber want to take a cabined view of it: If youre a judicial nominee, its fine to attend the occasional worship service, but dont let on that you take it too seriously. That is unacceptable. From the inception of our republic, religious believers have chosen to serve their country in countless ways. Whether through the armed forces, holding elected office, or sitting on the courts, Americans of faith have always answered the call. We should welcome this service. And we should not sit idly by while others question the propriety of their service by suggesting a de facto religious test. The Framers of the Constitution were fearful of this very thinking. They understood the importance of religious participation and foresaw the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds would contribute to the common good. They also knew from centuries of war and suffering in Europe the high costs of religious intolerance. Thats why they made it clear in Article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a religious test. This edict is entirely unambiguous in its language and intent. This country is to be served by people of all faiths, committed to the Constitution and the common good. It is up to us to question the qualifications and jurisprudence of nominees, not their religious views. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening to Professor Barrett. I was at her confirmation hearing, where she faced inappropriate questions and objections based on her religious views. I witnessed a citizen heeding the call to serve her country, face inquiries into her religious beliefs that bordered on ridicule. My friends on the other side of the aisle defend their questions and their conduct, and I dont doubt their sincerity. But there is little comfort in the defense that it doesnt matter that Professor Barrett is a Catholic--but somehow it matters what sort of Catholic Professor Barrett is. These are unconstitutional distinctions without differences. In addition, otherwise-respectable news outlets have provided sensational reports of Professor Barretts personal charismatic religious practices. As a member of the United States Senate, I find this troubling. As a person of faith, I find this objectionable. And, above all, as an American, I find this abhorrent. It is religious liberty  enshrined in constitutional provisions like Article Six and the First Amendment  that has allowed my faith and so many others to flourish in the United States. And it is religious liberty that is threatened when we seek to evaluate the fitness of nominees for high office based on religious orthodoxy. I have endeavored to be consistent on this issue during time in public service. When the presidential nominee of my Party, the Party of Lincoln, called for a Muslim ban it was wrong. Thats not what we stand for. When a judge expressed his personal belief that a practicing Muslim shouldnt be a member of Congress because of his religious faith, it was wrong. That this same judge is now my partys nominee for the Senate from Alabama should concern us all. Religious tests should have no place in the Senate. Standing up for people of faith, whether Muslim or Catholic, who are facing unfair prejudice should be an act of basic conscience. It should be expected of all of us, regardless of party. It is no better for Democrats to evaluate a judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a congressman for the Quran on which he does the same. To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would disregard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrinewhen she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would notis as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow be forced to follow sharia law over the Constitution. Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question. So I ask, in light of these circumstances  who will stand today against all cases of religious bigotry? Are there true liberals here who will stand up for the liberal values of religious tolerance? Some, like Professors Larry Tribe, Noah Feldman, and Chris Eisgruber. They have said, enough. Who here will join them? This very body is made up of individuals of near 15 different faiths. Each of us has sworn an oath to the Constitution. Each of us feel we can competently carry out our duties, as do those in the judicial branch who swear a similar oath to uphold the constitution. Mr. President, let us stand together today and without equivocation say no to religious intolerance in all its forms by examining the jurisprudential views and professional qualifications of the judicial nominees  not their relationships with the Almighty. ###", "title": "Flake: Religious tests should have no place in the Senate", "label": "real", "id": 207}
{"message": "So, this is very, very important, that this is a two-year period so that people can apply. And it allows our law enforcement officials to focus on criminals who really posed a threat and ought to be the focus here. But the only permanent way to fix our immigration system, certainly to provide a permanently relief for DREAM Act eligible populations is for Congress to act. WALLACE: You mentioned Governor Romney. I don't to get into the whole thing about the differences will get to the economy in a minute. But specifically for Hispanic voters, do you think there's a clear choice between Obama and Romney? PLOUFFE: I think there's a clear choice for everybody. WALLACE: Well, I'm asking about Hispanics. PLOUFFE: Well, first of all -- WALLACE: On this issue of immigration. PLOUFFE: Well, first of all, Hispanic voters highly support the health care bill, what we're trying to do in education. On immigration, yes, this is a president who's tried to get immigration done in a comprehensive way. We're getting close to getting the DREAM Act done. So, this is someone who believed that we are a nation of laws, but also a nation of immigrants. And that people who want to staff our labs and start businesses and serve their country ought to be able to do that. Governor Romney has said he would veto the DREAM Act. Governor Romney essentially said the 11 million here ought to just go home. They ought to self deport. So, this is someone you're not going to be able to trust. And this one of the important choices that the president talked about earlier this week in Ohio. President Romney if he's elected is not going to fix our immigration system. He's been very clear about that. You watch Republican debate after Republican debate, many of them on your network, where Governor Romney was very clear, he would veto the DREAM Act. He thinks these 11 million people ought to just be sent home. So, I think that's a clear choice just not for the Latino community, but for the American electorate at large. WALLACE: All right. Let's turn to the economy. The president gave a major economic speech this week in Ohio in which he called for targeted investments for things like energy and education and state workers, first responders and teachers, and tax hikes for the wealthy. But there was -- forgive me -- nothing new. Is that the president's agenda for the next four years -- pass the jobs plan that I have been pushing for over the last 12 months and that will fix the economy? PLOUFFE: What the president laid out is a clear choice facing the American people. And the contrast could not be clear. This is a president who believes we need to grow the economy by putting the middle class first, creating middle class jobs, by reducing the deficit in a fair or balanced way, and making sure we can invest in things like innovation and infrastructure and science and research. The congressional Republican approach, Governor Romney's approach -- by the way, it's fitting, he's with John Boehner today -- because Governor Romney is going to rubber stamp the Republican agenda, which basically gives huge tax cuts for the wealthy. They believe the economy works best from the top down. That's failed. By the way, Governor Romney wouldn't reduce the deficit. Every independent economists who's looked at this plan says he would add to the deficit, he would starve investment in education, he would allow infrastructure to deteriorate even more. This is not a recipe for growing the economy, reducing the deficit or helping the middle class. So, that's the stark choice -- WALLACE: Does the president's agenda -- because I did not hear anything new in Ohio -- is the president's agenda for the next four years more of the same? PLOUFFE: Well, what it is, is what this country needs to do, which is reduce the deficit in a right way, fair and balanced way. WALLACE: I like the fact that you keep saying fair and balanced. PLOUFFE: Well, it's the right way, which is we need to cut more spending. This president has already signed into law, by the way, over -- almost $2 trillion on spending cuts. We have to focus on what is going to grow this economy for the middle class. And that's going to be continuing to focus on our manufacturing -- WALLACE: But you would agree, there is no new agenda beyond what he is pushing for the last year? PLOUFFE: This is the direction he thinks that the country needs to go. Now, let's look at the other direction, it failed miserably. When Governor Romney led Massachusetts, number one debt in the country -- think about that. Added debt. For all of this talk about government, for every private sector job created in Massachusetts by Governor Romney, six public sector jobs. This is someone who -- his state was 47 in job creation. And he wants to return to the same policies that led to the great recession that, you know, caused a huge harm to our businesses, our economy and people in this country. So, the choice is clear here. WALLACE: OK. PLOUFFE: The choice is clear. WALLACE: I have a couple of minutes left and I want to get to these campaign questions. You were the Obama campaign manager in 2008. I ask about whether there's anything new, because you are taking hits right now -- you, the campaign -- from some notable Democrats like James Carville and Bill Clinton, who are saying that you need to stop talking about the progress we've made and start talking about a new agenda, how things in the next four years are going to be different than they were in the last one. Are they wrong? PLOUFFE: First of all, President Clinton, he's appeared with President Obama. He said very clearly that we are beginning to grow again. We're beginning to make progress. We can't return to the same policy. President Clinton is someone knows something about reducing the deficit, about creating jobs, and he's been very clear -- he thinks Mitt Romney would be a disaster for this country. So, listen, those other Democrats aren't paying attention to what the president said, which is everyday, not just on what he said, but what he does -- he understands our economy is not strong as it needs to be, that this didn't happen overnight, it's going to take us a long time to recover, there's a lot of people out there hurting. So, we are making progress. We need to make a lot of more. That's very clear. WALLACE: But you said, just a few months ago, that trajectory in the economy is going well. We had fewer and fewer jobs, each of the last four months. GDP growth is 1.9 percent, 69,000 jobs, the lowest in the year created. The trajectory is not going like this anymore, sir. It's going like this. PLOUFFE: Well, compared to where we were in recession we had over 4 million jobs created over the last 26 months. We had that private sector jobs -- WALLACE: But you've got three and a half years to fix it. PLOUFFE: Well, listen, this is a deep hole caused by the same policies Mitt Romney wants to go back to. This is what folks need to focus on. We just went through recession. Remarkably, what Mitt Romney and the congressional Republicans want to do is, hey, I guess that worked out well. Let's go back to the same rules. Let Wall Street writes its own rules, make it easier to polluters to foul our air more, huge tax cuts to people like Mitt Romney and basically paid for by raising taxes on working Americans, and making it harder for people to get education, not believing in the new energy future, not rebuilding this country. So, listen, this is a tough recession we are recovering from. We are making slow and steady progress. Nobody is satisfied. The president most of all knows we have to recover more quickly, create jobs more quickly. But the choice is, are we going to continue and move forward -- are we going to go back to the same policies that caused the recession? WALLACE: I got it. One last question -- PLOUFFE: It's important. Nothing is more important than this, Chris. WALLACE: One more question real quickly, any chance you'll leave the White House, go back to Chicago and run this campaign.", "title": "David Plouffe, Sen. Joe Lieberman and Gen.

{"message": "This is a rush transcript from \"On the Record,\" June 24, 2009. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Forty Republican members of Congress are furious at ABC News. They say ABC News is unprofessional and violating the ethics of journalism and slanting the news for President Obama. ABC News has been given all access to the White House, and in a primetime special on ABC News, President Obama will talk about his health care plan. Any problem with that? A group called the Media Fairness Caucus says yes and wrote a letter to ABC News slamming the network. Congressman Lamar Smith heads the Media Fairness Caucus. He was supposed to be with us live but is busy voting, but he does join us by phone. Congressman, nice to at least hear from you. Tell me, Congressman, what's wrong with this? REP. LAMAR SMITH - R - TEXAS (VIA TELEPHONE): Very good to be with you. Well, what's wrong with this is, as you just mentioned, ABC devoted all their newscasts today, morning, noon, evening, and then they culminated in a town hall meeting from the White House tonight with a hand-picked audience, and the president had the last word. That really amounts to a day-long informational (SIC). It's not giving the American people the facts. It's not letting them make up their own minds. It's telling them what to think. And it is unprofessional. The code of ethics for journalists says that they have a duty to provide a fair and comprehensive account (INAUDIBLE) issues. Clearly, this is not... VAN SUSTEREN: Let me ask you -- OK, all right, I haven't seen this code of ethics. Lawyers have a code of professional responsibility, which I'm always quick to point out. Here's the thing. Everything that happened today on ABC is recorded or Tivoed or we have access to it. Now that ABC News has done that, we now know the White House -- we should know the comprehensive view of the White House on health care. Doesn't it instead give all of us an opportunity to go over it with a fine-toothed comb tomorrow to see what we like and what we don't like? Is there any problem with that? SMITH: No, we should, but the problem is, we only heard one side. Anybody who was watching ABC today... VAN SUSTEREN: We'll hear it tomorrow. We'll hear it tomorrow. I mean, people are going to pick it apart tomorrow. In some ways, now at least we know what the White House, what the president's doing. SMITH: We certainly know... VAN SUSTEREN: Tomorrow we can pick apart. SMITH: Yes. Well, I hope -- you know, if ABC allows individuals to pick it apart tomorrow, those watching ABC will get both sides. But right now, they've only gotten one side. And it was like... VAN SUSTEREN: Yes, but... SMITH: It was like a rigged football game. They had -- the president had home field advantage. ABC was the only referee. The opposing team wasn't allowed on the field. But ABC didn't even allow ads that opposed the president's health care plan to be aired. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the ads is a wholly different thing. And I'll agree with you on the ads. But tomorrow, I bet that FOX, CNN, even MSNBC and NBC and CBS -- I bet they will all be critiquing what the president said about health care. SMITH: Well... VAN SUSTEREN: And but for this forum tonight -- and it's almost like a direct examination was tonight and now tomorrow, everybody can cross- examine it. And but for today, we wouldn't have that chance. SMITH: Right. But the problem with that is that the three networks, who have 10 times the number of viewers as FOX, for example -- they have 24 million viewers. FOX has 2.5 million. But the problem is that those three networks have all been given slanted coverage to the president's health care plan. You have ABC -- since January, for example, they interviewed 58 people in favor of the health care plan, only 18 opposed, three to one. They are not presenting both sides. And the American people deserve to get both sides if they're going to be able to make good decisions. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, one hour on ABC is 44 minutes, taking into account all the -- ABC News -- taking into account all the commercials. Tomorrow, there's going to be -- you know, the 24/7 of all the cables, so I'm not so sure -- and I realize that they have more viewers on broadcast as opposed to cable news, but we have so much more time on it that I'm not -- you know, that I don't know how it'll balance out. But I guess -- I guess the other thing is, that -- you know, it's, like, it seems to me that this is an opportunity for all of us, for Americans to now -- to look at it with a fine-toothed comb. And I may be the only one who's not scandalized by it, and frankly, I haven't yet seen it, so I got to take a look at it, so... SMITH: Well, it's... VAN SUSTEREN: ... it may even be premature for me to be scandalized anyway. SMITH: If you'd seen how one-sided it is, you'd be scandalized because it is not representing good journalism. It has not presented both sides. It is not giving the American people the facts. You have a recent Gallup poll, for example, that says on 9 percent of the American people think the news media reports the news accurately and fairly -- 9 percent. So the... VAN SUSTEREN: Well, that's another -- that's -- that's a whole other issue, but Congressman, maybe -- let's see in 24 hours whether or not everybody has gone over this and -- with a fine-toothed comb. You may be right, but let's at least give it a shot tomorrow, see whether this has been... SMITH: Well, I... VAN SUSTEREN: ... dissected. SMITH: I hope people will take the time to look at the other side. They certainly didn't get it from ABC. VAN SUSTEREN: Thank you, sir, for joining us. SMITH: Thank you. VAN SUSTEREN: Sorry it couldn't be in person because I know you're busy voting. Thank you, sir. SMITH: All right. Bye-bye. Content and Programming Copyright 2009 FOX News Network, LLC.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning and welcome to \"This Week.\" Watching everything. (START VIDEO CLIP) SAWYER: America's phone records, but also internet searches are under surveillance. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: A secret government program tracking our phones, casting a wide net across the internet. (START VIDEO CLIP) OBAMA: I want to be very clear, nobody is listening to your telephone calls. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Has this protected national security? (START VIDEO CLIP) ROGERS: This program was used to stop a terrorist attack. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: At what cost to personal privacy? (START VIDEO CLIP) PAUL: I am appalled. It's a violation of the Bill of Rights. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: This morning, we cover the controversy from all angles. The reporter who broke the story, Glen Greenwald. The Senator who sounded the alarm, Mark Udall, and the Committee Chairs who approved the program, Senator Diane Feinstein, and Congressman Mike Rogers. Plus our Powerhouse Roundtable on that, and all the weeks politics with ABC's George Will and Matthew Dowd, Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman from the New York Times, Congressman Keith Ellison, and Great Van Susteren from Fox News. ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Reporting from ABC News Headquarters, George Stephanopoulos. STEPHANOPOULOS: Hello again. The secret struggle to balance national security and individual liberty broke out into open this week, after a series of blockbuster revelations, starting in The Guardian newspaper. We learned that the government has the capacity to track virtually every American phone call, and to scoop up impossibly vast quantities of data across the Internet. And our first guest is The Guardian columnist getting these scoops, Glenn Greenwald. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Greenwald. You are really on a roll. You broke another story yesterday showing the scale of the data collection programs. In March 2013, you report the government collected 97 billion pieces of data, almost all of it from outside the U.S. What's the key finding here? GREENWALD: There are two key findings. One is that there are members of the Congress who have responsibility for oversight, for checking the people who run this vast secret apparatus of spying to make sure they are not abusing their power. These people in Congress have continuously asked for the NSA to provide basic information about how many Americans they are spying on, how many conversations and telephone and chats of -- of Americans they are intercepting, and the NSA continuously tells them, we don't have the capability to tell you that, to even give you a rough estimate. So what these documents that we published show, that were marked top-secret to prevent the American people from learning about them, was that the NSA keeps extremely precise statistics, all the data that the senators amassed where that the NSA has falsely claimed does not exist. And the other thing that it does, as you said, is it indicates just how vast and massive the NSA is in terms of sweeping up all forms of communication around the globe, including domestically. STEPHANOPOULOS: You also drew new criticism yesterday from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He called the disclosures reckless, said the rush to publish has created significant misimpressions and added that the articles are filled with inaccuracies.

{"message": "May 23, 2010  -- TAPPER: Hello again. Joining me now, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tim Kaine, and the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele. Gentlemen, welcome. KAINE: Hey, Jake, good to be with you. STEELE: Jake, good to see you. TAPPER: I want to get to the general election results in a second, but first, I want to bear in on a couple of controversies we have, and I'm going to start with you, Mr. Steele. STEELE: OK. TAPPER: I don't know if you were expecting (ph) that or not-- STEELE: Kind of. (LAUGHTER) TAPPER: The Kentucky Senate candidate, Rand Paul, has expressed his objections philosophically to the federal government being able to tell businesses that they cannot discriminate. Here's Rand Paul. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAND PAUL, SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, R-KY.: I like the Civil Rights Act in a sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains. I abhor racism. I think it's a bad business decision to ever exclude anybody from your restaurant. But at the same time, I do believe in private ownership. There's ten different titles, you know, to the Civil Rights Act. One deals with private institutions, and had I been around, I would have tried to modify that. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Chairman Steele, you have worked so hard to bring minorities into the Republican Party. Here is a Senate candidate saying that he doesn't think the government, philosophically, should be able to tell a business that they can't -- that they have to serve you. STEELE: Right, right. TAPPER: Do you have an issue with that? STEELE: Well, I do, and I think it's important to understand that Rand Paul has clarified his statement and has reiterated his support for and, you know, movement towards pushing civil rights forward as opposed to going backwards, number one. Number two, our party has always had a strong view on this issue. We fought very hard in the '60s to get the civil rights bill passed as well as the voting rights bill. So I think that, you know, any -- any, you know, attempted look backwards, it's not in the best interests of our country, certainly, and certainly not in the best interests of the party. So, you know, I've talked to Rand. He and I are on the same page. Our party stands four-square about moving forward on civil rights. Looking at the civil rights issues of the day -- education, for example -- there are many other fights that loom ahead for us in this area, so Rand Paul as United States senator will be four-square with the Republican Party, in lockstep with moving forward on civil rights, not looking backwards. TAPPER: Chairman Kaine, this is traditionally a Republican seat. Do these views of Rand Paul make this seat more competitive in your mind? KAINE: Absolutely, they do, Jake. Of course, it starts with our candidate, Jack Conway, who's the attorney general, I think he's going to run a great race. But Rand Paul's views on this, his statement this week that he thinks it's un-American for President Obama to try to hold British Petroleum accountable for the spill in the Gulf-- TAPPER: Let's talk about that. What do you think about that? STEELE: Well, I mean, our own speaker of the House referred to American citizens as un-American, so I think referring to a policy which he did not say it was un-American per se. He said going in that direction could be an un-American-- TAPPER: We have -- we actually have the video clip. Let's watch that. (CROSSTALK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL: What I don't like from the president's administration is this sort of, you know, I'll put my boot heel on the throat of BP, and I think it's part of this sort of blame game society in the sense that it's always got to be someone's fault, instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Certainly, accidents happen is not what you want the Republican response about the BP oil spill-- STEELE: Well, you know, well, look, I mean, it's not -- people shouldn't worry about the Republican response to the BP oil spill. They should worry about the Democrat president's response to the BP oil spill. It is one thing to actually get on the ground and get in front of this thing. It's another thing to sit back and hold BP accountable without helping them, and that's what's happening here. I mean, the federal government should have stepped into this thing immediately, to help make sure that the appropriate steps are being taken by BP, all federal agencies in support of the state government to try to get this thing cleaned up. And here we are, almost a month and a half later, and it's still spilling oil. TAPPER: How about that, Chairman Kaine? A lot of Democrats are criticizing the Obama administration for not doing enough to hold BP accountable. KAINE: The administration is doing two things. It starts with BP's accountability, and Rand Paul is wrong. It isn't un-American to hold somebody accountable for a massive environmental disaster of this kind. This isn't just a mistake that we can wash away. BP has got to be accountable for stopping the spill and then cleaning up and paying for the consequences. The administration has had a team working with BP from the very beginning trying to look at ways to help them do it, but it is BP's job. They have to be held accountable, and saying that it's just a mistake that needs to be washed away, or saying, as Rand Paul did, for example, that, you know, we needn't be so worried about things like mining regulations -- I mean, this is a very important role that the government has, to protect the safety of the environment and the health of its citizens. And so, Rand Paul's statements along these lines are very, very troubling, and it's important for Republican leaders to say whether they back this kind of an attitude or not.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Kaine and Steele", "label": "real", "id": 212}

Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists. Advertisement Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear. ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups  they dont want Trump in office, said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim. ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State. Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is scared to death of him. Share this article Share Hes a threat to them, she said. Thats the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want. Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trumps rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.

Theyre going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous. In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our countrys representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word hell, according to CNN. In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would strongly consider shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others. I would hate to do it, but its something that youre going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred  the absolute hatred  is coming from these areas, Trump said in an interview on Morning Joe. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology.

No Muslims coming to the United States, other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements  it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists. Trumps comments, Clinton added, lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.

{"message": "July 11, 2010  -- JAKE TAPPER, HOST: I know that there are some in the White House who feel Wall Street reform, health care legislation, stimulus, and yet the public still overwhelmingly thinks this country is on the wrong track. Are you not getting enough credit, you and the administration? JOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, these are gigantic packages to deal with a gigantic problem we inherited. And the vast majority of the American people and a lot of people really involved don't even know what's inside the packages. And so you have, for example, Mr. Boehner already calling for the repeal of -- of the reform that just passed on Wall Street. People don't realize, in that reform, you know, you say, look, we've had meat inspection for 100 years ago, the meat packing companies didn't like it. Automobile safety 50 years ago. People are going to look back on this very shortly and say, why shouldn't we have some consumer group in -- entity looking at whether or not you can give someone a mortgage with no down payment, with no -- with a teaser interest rate, with no documentation, etc. So it is -- people don't know that. Just like people don't know a lot of what's going on in The Recovery Act, understandably, because this has been so much stuff that has been flowing our way. And -- and we're facing a bunch of guys who are good guys, but they're all about repeal and -- and repeat. Repeal what we're doing and go back, repeal the incentives for industry to invest in solar energy. Repeal the health care bill that allows you to keep your kid on your health care policy, precondi -- preexisting conditions can't deny you policies, etc. It's just going to take time. This is Jan -- this is July. The election is not until November. And I think we're going to have to firmly make our case. I think we can make it and especially in the context of who's going to be opposing us. Compared to the alternative, I think we're going to get a fair amount of credit by November and I think we're going to do fine. TAPPER: So the reason you're not getting enough credit is because the public doesn't understand everything that's happened yet? BIDEN: Well, nor could they or should they. Look, in the last six months of the Bush administration, they lost three million jobs. Before we got our economic package in place, another 3.7 million jobs were lost in the first six months we took office. The last six months of this year -- the first six months of this year, we created almost 600,000 private jobs, you know, in the private market. That's not nearly enough to make up for the eight million jobs lost in the recession. But people are going to start to focus on exactly what we're doing. And all -- look, I'm convinced, at least from sitting around my dad's kitchen table and -- and the people I grew up with is when things are really tough economically and the country is in trouble, all they want to know is, they -- they don't expect an answer, but they expect to be reassured that we're moving in the right direction. That is... TAPPER: But they don't think that we are. BIDEN: No. No, they don't think now because I don't think they know the detail of what's going on. For example, here you had the insurance industry spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make the health care bill out to be this God awful tragedy. Now what's starting off to happen? The health care numbers are going up. Why? Because they're figuring out that small businesses are going to get a 30 percent tax cut. They didn't know that because of all the advertising done. So there's a lot -- and -- and I would use health care as an example. Health care has gone from a barrage of advertising against it, why it was so bad, just like Wall Street reform. The financial industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying against this  this is an awful thing, it's government regulation. All it is, is rational control and the turning around of what the Republicans did, which is let Wall Street run wild. People -- when you say to people, you know, we just went out and had a regulatory reform bill, where I come from, it's like, OK, what -- what does that mean? They don't know what it means yet, understandably. And so I think it takes time, Jake. TAPPER: There's that famous saying in Washington by Mike Kinsley that a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. Robert Gibbs experienced some of that this -- this past few days... BIDEN: I've never had a gaffe. TAPPER: You've never had an issue with gaffes. (LAUGHTER) TAPPER: No, I know. So you can't relate. BIDEN: Yeah. TAPPER: But -- but he said that enough seats are in the play in the House for the Democrats to possibly lose the House. Empirically true. How bad are the losses going to be for Democrats? BIDEN: I don't think the losses are going to be bad at all. I think we're going to shock the heck out of everybody. I really -- and I've been saying this now. I think even when you and I went down to North Carolina and you followed be on the recovery trip, I was saying it then. I am absolutely confidence -- confident when people take a look at the what has happened since we've taken office in November and comparing it to the alternative, we're going to be very -- we're going to be in great shape. Here's the deal. What Robert Gibbs also said was what he believes, what I believe, what the president believes, we're going to win the House and we're going to win the Senate. We're not going to lose either one of those bodies. And so, again, this is July. November and at the time, the most vulnerable time any public official finds himself in is when they have no opponent. Look at Harry Reid. You know, I got -- I got kind of banged around for saying I think there was a 55 percent chance Harry Reid is going to win. Well, Harry Reid, when he was the -- you know, on the other side of the barrage of how bad Harry Reid was, was in trouble. Now Harry Reid, in the last poll, was up 7 points. I -- he I think he -- I -- I'd bet anything -- I'm not allowed to bet, but I'll bet Harry Reid wins. You're going to see that repeated. So, that old -- to paraphrase Mark Twain, I think the -- the reports of our demise are premature. TAPPER: The NAACP had a convention in the last week.

{"message": "Story highlights The Trump transition team says his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump promised to force Mexico to pay for the wall Washington CNN  President-elect Donald Trumps transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall. Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! Trump tweeted Friday. The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017 New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico. When you understand that Mexicos economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play, Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNNs Alisyn Camerota on New Day. On the trade negotiation side, I dont think its that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that its in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall. The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings theyd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. Intel report says US identifies go-betweens who gave emails to WikiLeaks It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization thats already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trumps campaign pledge to secure the border, Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday. Messer admitted its big dollars, but its a question of priorities. He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion. Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence, Messer said. Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall. The Associated Press and Politico first reported elements of the talks earlier Thursday. If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown. No decisions have been made, GOP sources said. Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort. The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time. Black Caucus launches longshot effort to derail Sessions nomination as attorney general Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall. We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall, Scalise said. Were in talks with him on the details of it as theyre still putting together their team. We still got a few months before theres another funding bill thats going to move. Were going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall. Could Mexico pay for the border wall? Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion. And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the walls full cost. According to Trumps website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico. A major challenge for judging Trumps proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket  less than $1 billion  compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money  remittance seizure  would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash. Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ($186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And its difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports  or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff  without the specifics of the tax. Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year. But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year  and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees  that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag. The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country. According to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24.8 billion in remittance payments in 2015. A Fox News Latino report calculated that 97% of remittance payments received by Mexico in the first three months of 2015 came from the US, and the Pew Research Center similarly reported that nearly all of Mexicos remittance payment revenue comes from the U.S. Seizing all of that money would probably be more than enough to pay for the border wall. Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trumps plan would likely face multiple legal battles. The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the Radical Islamic Terrorists that the Patriot Act was designed to fight, says Callan. The courts are likely to view Mr. Trumps use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut. The size of Mexicos remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, its difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.", "title": "Trump asking Congress, not Mexico, to pay for border wall", "label": "real", "id": 223}

Fast, informative and written just for locals. Get The 7 DMV newsletter in your inbox every weekday morning. ArrowRight But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project  billionaire developer Donald Trump  put himself at the center of the nations debate over illegal immigration. Trump garnered headlines  and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him  when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and rapists crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico. But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trumps comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs  while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs. Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments. Here are some of the key moments. (Video: The Washington Post) All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16. Advertisement Its something ironic, said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel. The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally, Arellano said in Spanish. And were all here working very hard to build a better life for our families. Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives. Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally. Advertisement Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem, said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his countrys civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said. He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here, Gonzalez said of Trump. Donald Trump announces presidential run + 23 The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. Several of the laborers  who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day  fumed at Trumps comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children. Do you think that when were hanging out there from the eighth floor that were raping or selling drugs? Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. Were risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic. Advertisement In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the sites several hundred workers. Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law, the e-mailed statement said. Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws, the statement said. Share this article Share Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site. Advertisement Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor, Cohen said in a telephone interview. That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees status is accurate. A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016. Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trumps political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter. Trumps comments about illegal immigration  which included a promise to build a great, great wall on our southern border and bill Mexico for the cost  reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his companys real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country. Advertisement The rapid rejection of Trumps comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field. Trumps comments were popular with conservative activists across the country  and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the moguls remarks. The NBC television network, the Macy's department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump  part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes. Advertisement On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef Jos Andrs to \"dump Trump\" by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump's hotel. At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trumps name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotels 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows. The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington  with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the buildings heyday as the Districts main post office in the early 20th century. Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general. Advertisement Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish. Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. Most of the workers here are migrants, he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: I dont think its right, what he said. Theyre hard workers. For David Montoya, 28, Trumps comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed, he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status. Advertisement Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story  one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off  is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.

{"message": "Rick Santorum: By amending constitution, we can balance the budget for good By RICK SANTORUM Last summer, we saw a great groundswell of national support to get our fiscal house in order by cutting and capping federal spending and passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. However, the President refused to lead and instead pushed the tough decisions to a bureaucratic Washington committee to solve the problem, and though it was named the 'Supercommittee' it couldn't even agree on cutting Post-It Notes from the office supply closet. Now, because of the inaction, we are faced with drastic defense cuts at a time when reports show a nuclear Iran has emerged as a clear and present danger.I supported the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' movement, but the reality is that what we really need is 'Balance, Balance, Grow' - because without a balanced budget amendment, and a path to economic prosperity, we cannot ever trust the government to actively try and balance the federal budget.Both parties can talk all they want about fiscal responsibility, but passing a balanced budget amendment that requires a supermajority for any tax increase and puts a cap on federal spending at 18 percent of GDP is the only way to permanently ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.Currently, government spending has exploded to nearly 25 percent of GDP and is well on its way to 40 percent. This is unacceptable and must be stopped.Yes, we should cut spending now, but our ultimate goal is to shrink the size and scope of the federal government forever, and passing a balanced budget amendment will permanently cap spending and ensure that our government cannot grow beyond its means.This cornerstone of my economic policy ultimately empowers the American family and builds economic freedom.A balanced budget amendment is a long-term, permanent fix to over-spending, and it would not be a 'draconian' method because it would not happen overnight. The process to pass and ratify a constitutional amendment will take six to eight years. That not only gives our government time to put our budget on a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, but it sets a deadline for our representatives to get the job done.The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work. The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding 'no' vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.Passing a balanced budget amendment will also force our government to address the entitlement crisis crippling our economy. For years, every member of Congress has been afraid of touching entitlements because it is considered the 'third rail of politics.' But with the passage of the balanced budget amendment, we'll be forced to address this crucial piece of the fiscal puzzle. I know that we can make the tough choices necessary to restructure and save those programs because we've done it before. In 1996, I led the fight to reform the welfare system, ending dependency for millions and providing them with avenues to get back to work. I led that fight and got conservative results despite opposition from a popular President, Bill Clinton, who vetoed the bill twice.And finally, we must implement policies to immediately grow our economy, and this starts with revitalizing our manufacturing sector, which can be the great multiplier on our economy. Yes, we must make more things in America again, but first, we must create an environment that breeds more opportunity here at home. We must eliminate the corporate tax for manufacturers, eliminate all Obama-era regulations that cost business more than $100 million a year, and eliminate the excise tax on overseas profits when those revenues are reinvested in American plants and equipment. We must also make sure the government is not in the way of energy production, and instead increase all forms of energy exploration: whether oil, natural gas, coal, etc. We must reduce the cost of energy across the board for everyone who goes to the pump to fill up their automobile and for the manufacturing plant that produces the automobile itself. This will jump-start our economy, broaden our tax base and, most importantly, rebuild the great middle of our society that has been lost along with our manufacturing jobs over the past 40 years.You can trust my commitment to getting this economy going again, and together we can finish the job we came so close to completing: passing a balanced budget amendment, which is the only way to keep our budget under control for good.

{"message": "The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president, George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A and M, said. This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally its not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president is pretty unusual. As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, hes made his displeasure clear. Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was heartened by the protests following Trumps immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trumps attempts to repeal it. At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act, Obama said Sunday. And on Monday, Obamas aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trumps disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynns security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynns erratic nature. George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy, Bush said in an interview with Today in February. We need an independent media to hold people like me to account. As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. I am for an immigration policy thats welcoming and upholds the law, Bush said. Carter also voiced concerns after Trumps inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the womens movement would be invigorated by Trump and that he didnt see any glimmer of hope from the administration on race and gender issues. Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessmans presidential campaign, didnt mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. He doesnt know much, Clinton said in late December. One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him. George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary. Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor. Weve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but thats not really unprecedented, Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new. Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carters chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president. Theres a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue, he said. You dont try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president. While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource. Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation, Mack McLarty, Clintons former chief of staff, said. For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified. Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake. What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president, Naftali said. If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency. All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April. But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was encouraged by their first post-election meeting. Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama. He was very nice to me, but after that, weve had some difficulties, Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was inappropriate. Former President Barack Obama speaks at a community event on the Presidential Center at the South Shore Cultural Center, Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Chicago. The Obama Foundation unveiled plans for the former president's lakefront presidential center, showcasing renderings and a model at an event where former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were expected to give more details. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) Historically speaking, Trumps relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. That one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own, she said And Trump hasnt shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a bad (or sick) guy! as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush not nice during the campaign, said the Bush administration lied about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history. George H.W. Bush and Carter werent excluded from Trumps slights. Enough is Enough- No More Bushses! Trump tweeted during the campaign. He alsocriticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage. Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration. And Carter hasnt always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and  while revealing that he voted for Sanders  Carter said the downturn of human rights preceded 2016. President Carter, I think he hopes that he wont need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it, Hochman said. Actually, Im sure he would. Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bushs chief of staff. Hes spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump. They may have personal opinions, but theyre not going to express them, Skinner said. Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think theyve been both very cautious about what they say. McLarty, Clintons former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. I wouldnt be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies, he said. Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not todays events in Washington. I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries, he said.", "title": "Former presidents walk fine line in Trumps America", "label": "fake", "id": 229}

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said: No, man.

{"message": "Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSAs surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune. According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA. I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIAs payroll, claims Edward Snowden. He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children. Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family in an undisclosed location in the Bahamas. Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIAs most efficient operatives for a long time, claims the famous whistleblower. What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobodys looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him. Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September. Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists. The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.

{"message": "President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and hes already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Heres what WJ just reported: The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the Questionnaire for National Security Positions. The 127-page document includes questions on the applicants credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects. The six staffers included the daughter of President Trumps Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles: Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico. The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions. Its striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldnt be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be their most sacred obligation. Schiff added, referring to Trump: Im sure there are people in the community who feel they dont know where hes coming from on Russia.'

The allegations claim that Moore had intimate relations with an underage female around 40 years ago. More reports have come to the surface that are bringing the bizarre story to an entirely new level. The Washington Post reported on Thursday allegations about an incident involving Moore that took place in 1979 between Moore (who was 39 at the time) and a 14-year-old girl. A Twitter user named Doug Lewis posted on his page that a family friend had reached out to him about the situation. Lewiss profile shows him as a Trump supporter and a Navy veteran. The woman, who is remaining anonymous, apparently told Lewis that a Washington Post reporter who was called Beth had offered to pay the woman a large sum of money if she wold accuse GOP candidate Moore of the crime. Lewiss tweet read, A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore. A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore???? In later tweets, Lewis continued to report that the family friend had photographs of the reporter who reached out to her. She had even recorded the phone conversation. Lewis explained that he told the family friend to bring the recording and the photograph to her local district attorneys office. He also insisted that she make a copy of both the recording and the photo for herself as back up. JustBrenda, another Twitter user, wrote a response to Lewiss tweet. She stated that she wouldnt be surprised if the allegations about the reporter stood to be true. She went on to say that anyone who makes up sexual offenses make things harder for real victims. Lewis wrote a response to JustBrenda explaining hat he would find out the truth. He also stated that Jean, who we can only assume to be the family friend, had spoken to the Etowah County District Attorney about the evidence that she had obtained. According to Lewis, someone from the office was sent to pick up the phone call. Bradd Powless, another user on Twitter, told Lewis that he should report the occurrence to the FBI as well as the Secret Service.

Cant blame her with FBI in stories every day, Lewis added. It is important that while these allegations havent been proven true or disproven to be true, there may be bits and pieces that are accurate. There have been so many reports of sexual misconduct these days that it is important that all evidence and reports be investigated properly so the people of America can find out the truth. Moore has come forward to say that the allegations of sexual misconduct are false. Moore spoke to Newsweek and stated, These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and The Washington Post on this campaign. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now. The Alabama special election is only a few weeks away. By December 12th people will be voting, so Moore only has a limited amount of time to prove the allegations to be false. He must reassure conservative voters that he is the right choice for Senate now that former Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions is gone. Lets hope the truth comes out in time for voters to be able to make a rational decision.", "title": "Breaking: Woman Says She Was Offered Big Money By Washington Post to Accuse Roy Moore of Misconduct", "label": "fake", "id": 245}

Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump. During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic \"clear recovery,\" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.

Were bringing back the draft, okay? Were going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties, Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa. I love the Sixties, said Trump, continuing, I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do. In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. Were not going to give it to them, folks. Theyre going to have to earn their citizenship. Trump has repeatedly stated that he wont rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing man-portable tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. Were not going to have unquestionable military dominance if were seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies. Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option extremely liberally. My feeling is we have these weapons and weve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; theres absolutely no reason why we shouldnt be using them. The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. This guys the president of the United States and hes bowing to the Chinese. Theyre laughing in our faces, okay?

{"message": "WASHINGTON  Rod Jay Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice has been removed from his office. Nearly everyone who knows him seems to agree that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General and the official overseeing the special counsel Robert Muellers investigation of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, has a reputation for integrity. Rod who is described by Jim Trusty, the former head of the Justice Departments organized-crime division as a prosecutor, not a persecutor, had sought earlier to protect his good image by not taking a hastened decision to fire anyone without justifiable reasons. But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Muellers probe, so the only possible way is to throw the Justice Department into upheaval by firing Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who only holds the key Muellers expulsion. Only the person acting as attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein who was on matters related to the probe, could fire Mueller, and he said he wont do it without good cause. So Trump would first had to purge the upper ranks of the Justice Department until he finds someone willing to follow his orders and dismiss the special counsel. Conflicting reports claim Rosenstein had resigned but its understood that Donald Trump made the decision to remove him after a review from his chief of staff, John Kelly. UNDER the best of circumstanceswhen America has a president who is disciplined, willing to hear harsh but necessary truths and loyal to those he truststhe post of Attorney General is perhaps one of the most powerful job in Washington, according to Loretta Lynch. Loretta Elizabeth Lynch, an American attorney who served as the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015 to succeed Eric Holder. Loretta Lynch, a political giant who held that post for Barack Obama said, under ideal conditions, it is also the toughest job in government. Rosenstein, the hapless establishment Republican ousted as Deputy Attorney General on Monday December 4, 2017 lasted a smidgeon over few days. After days of increasingly public concerns over the likelihood of Muellers dismissal by Trump and amidst Trumps former national-security adviser, Michael Flynn, had pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal investigators about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, Mr Rosenstein is being replaced by Neil Gorsuch, who was recently nominated by Trump for a lifetime job on the U.S. Supreme Court. The reshuffle puts Mr Rosenstein out of his misery and confirms Mr Trumps fondness for surrounding himself with tough-as-nails generals, who already fill several top jobs in his government. It ends the fear of Trump administration being damaged by Flynns plea to Muellers investigation team. These are not anything like ideal circumstances for Mr Neil Gorsuch. New holder of the toughest job in government, the ex-clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992, and then for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, from 1993 to 1994. He currently was serving as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. How long Mr Neil Gorsuch lasts is anyones guess. If he only emerges with his dignity intact and adhere to the orders and principles of Trumps administration, he will have done better than his predecessor. President Donald Trumps interview with the New York Times on Wednesday stirred speculation he might consider firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller for investigating Trumps business dealings as part of the Russia probe. But Trump could not fire Mueller directly, according to the law that authorizes Muellers probe. Firing the Deputy Attorney General simply means setting off a chain-reaction that would throw the Justice Department into upheaval and consequently reaching his target to fire Robert Mueller under his dictatorship. Hed certainly begun by dismissing Rosenstein, whose political loyalties Trump questioned in the Times interview on Wednesday in which he also warned Mueller against broadening his investigation. Such a scenario would parallel President Richard Nixons 1973 Saturday Night Massacre, when Nixon forced out the top two officials in the Justice Department in order to oust the Watergate special counsel. I dont think thats politically survivable, and its not clear how much collateral damage he will do, putting himself into a position to have somebody fire Mueller, said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island. Expanding Investigation Muellers investigation has expanded to examine a broad range of transactions involving the presidents businesses, including dealings by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg News. Trump told the Times that if Mueller examined his familys finances beyond any relationship with Russia hed consider it a violation. There is no possible way anybody at the White House could be seriously thinking about firing Mueller, said Senate Bob Corker of Tennessee, a Republican. I dont even want to comment on that because thats so far out of bounds it couldnt possibly be a serious discussion. Undercutting Mueller Trump has indicated he would try to undercut Muellers credibility. In the New York Times interview, Trump said Mueller has many other conflicts that I havent said, but I will at some point. Separately, the Washington Post reported Thursday night that Trumps legal team was exploring ways to question Mueller by building a case that he has conflicts of interest in overseeing the investigation. The Post also cited one unidentified person familiar with the effort as saying that Trump has asked his advisers about his authority to grant pardons to aides, family members or even himself.", "title": "BREAKING: Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Muellers fate", "label": "fake", "id": 248}

Kirk Douglas was an American actor, producer, director, and author. He was one of the last living people of the film industrys Golden Age. After an impoverished childhood with immigrant parents and six sisters, he had his film debut in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck. Douglas soon developed into a leading box-office star throughout the 1950s and 1960s, known for serious dramas, including westerns and war movies. During his career he appeared in more than 90 movies. Douglas was well known for his explosive acting style. As an actor and philanthropist, Douglas had received three Academy Award nominations, an Oscar for Lifetime Achievement, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As an author, he had written ten novels and memoirs. He was No. 17 on the American Film Institutes list of the greatest male screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema, and the highest-ranked living person on the list.

George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country.

Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one. Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the 90s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets. Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros.

{"message": "Thousands of government workers are unsure whether or not they will be heading to work on Monday amid uncertainty about how long a government shutdown will last. Uncertainty is the byproduct of a government shutdown, with its impact often hard to predict. However, clues exist in the last shutdown, which was in 2013. Key services will continue, and many agencies plan to use carryover funds to remain open for several days. But each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies, government employees and civilian contractors, as well as Americans who rely on various federal services. Employees considered essential will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue, while those in positions deemed nonessential will be barred from coming in. The White House on Friday pledged to minimize the effects of the shutdown on the American people, with one official noting that the administration has urged government agencies to do as much as they can within the law to maintain operations. The push for departments and agencies to utilize existing funding to remain open suggests the Trump administration is hedging its bets that lawmakers can reach a deal and avoid a shutdown the length of one in 2013, which lasted 16 days. Each federal agency has a contingency plan for a shutdown that is written with help from the White Houses Office of Management and Budget. But the impact of the shutdown, which began at midnight when the Senate failed to pass a short-term spending bill, is likely to trickle down gradually as agencies work to mitigate the effects. About half of the Department of Health and Human Services will be placed on furlough. Beneficiaries of programs like Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid will still receive services. The Food and Drug Administration, however, will take a hit, as it will have to halt activities like food safety inspections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue immediate response work on influenza, according to White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyOvernight Finance: Lawmakers see shutdown odds rising | Trump calls for looser rules for bank loans | Consumer bureau moves to revise payday lending rule | Trump warns China on trade deficit Overnight Regulation: Dems claim 50 votes in Senate to block net neutrality repeal | Consumer bureau takes first step to revising payday lending rule | Trump wants to loosen rules on bank loans | Pentagon, FDA to speed up military drug approvals Consumer bureau takes first step to revising payday lending rule MORE. The National Park Service (NPS) will keep parks open, unlike in 2013, though much of its staff will not report to work. Services such as trash pickup and restroom cleaning will be halted, according to the NPS contingency plan for a shutdown. Cybersecurity will remain a priority during the shutdown, as the government will continue to protect information technology systems, Mulvaney said Saturday at a press conference. The Environmental Protection Agency will largely stay open during the government's closure, and the Labor Department will resume mine safety inspections. Military personnel will be required to show up for work, but will not receive pay for as long as the shutdown lasts. Families of slain military members will experience a halt to death benefits as a result of the shutdown. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel will continue operations, meaning travelers will see both TSA employees and canines operating in airports. The Federal Aviation Administrations (FAA) management of air traffic control will also continue. Flight delays are not expected and much of the FAA's safety inspections will continue. The government closure, a result of Congresss failed negotiations over a spending bill the last several weeks, has sparked both intraparty battles and fights between Democrats and Republicans. The two parties have each tried to cast blame on the other for the shutdown, with the Republican National Committee invoking the hashtag #SchumerShutdown, referring to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerDemocrats will need to explain if they shut government down over illegal immigration White House: Trump remarks didn't derail shutdown talks Schumer defends Durbin after GOP senator questions account of Trump meeting MORE (D-N.Y.).

The childs father was taken to a different hospital in critical condition, WBNS reported. A witness said Mohamed had a phone in her hand at the time of the crash, but there was no evidence of any texts or calls being received at the time. Four days earlier, the woman was in an accident in which she crashed into a median, The Columbus Dispatch reported. In both cases, she was driving on a temporary permit without an accompanying licensed driver. Not one of those single things amounts to recklessness, Judge Laurel Beatty Blunt said. But when you look at the totality of the circumstances, the court does rule that it does amount to reckless conduct. Mohamed, a native of Somalia, reportedly faced a prison sentence if convicted, but was allowed to remain free until her sentencing. If an American did the same thing they would be in jail for a long time, one Mad World News reader commented on the sites Facebook page. She should get the same or more being the 2nd accident in 4 days. Going off the side of the road and running over 2 innocent people killing a helpless baby. Come on people. Give her life in prison. She deserves more than that but Im sure she wont get the death penalty. What in the hell kind of Justice system do we have now. Define for me the difference between reckless conduct and recklessness, another wrote. Maybe in OHIO they speak different English than I do, after all I am from a rural state and may not understand the high English as interpreted by more citified judges. Where is justice?

Under the GOP proposal, millions of American households will be at risk of losing heat this winter, as reported by the Independent.co.uk Sadly, this is exactly what millions of Americans have been fearing. The Republicans are carrying out a major attack against poor people and senior citizens, all so they can give a few more tax cuts to their rich friends.

Government estimates suggest six million people rely on it to heat, cool, or weatherize their homes. This is just the latest example of the Trump administrations utter disregard for everyday people in our country.

{"message": "WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP)  At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days. Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days, Ryan told reporters. Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best. News of this comes as Russias hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions. If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment, Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud. Donald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it. We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know youll always remember me as the greatest President EVER! We think this is the best thing, Ryan continued. He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now its time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future. After word spread of Trumps impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter. I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, hes the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President. Lloyd Glacier, a spokesman for Sock It Forward, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trumps plan to resign. This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country. 38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go. When Im traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours, Horner said. Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now its all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, youre all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much! Praise Fappy!

{"message": "CNBC reported that Trump has substantial investments in the companies involved with the construction of the pipeline. Trumps early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it. Donald Trumps business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land. The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply. The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country. Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them. The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trumps own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation. Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes. And now we learn that President Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president. This should come as no surprise since Trump s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president. This involvement is another example of Trumps unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation. According to Ethics experts, Trumps decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust. The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it. The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trumps support of the cruel actions of the police. We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.

The despicable display reached the height of annoyance during every ego-stroking awards ceremony since President Trump was elected.

However, not everyone in Hollywood shares the same opinion as the most outspoken offender, Meryl Streep, as Kurt Russell just showed her and all of Trumps other famous foes that its time to shut up about our president. If you havent heard much from Russell lately, its because he falls into the rare category of celebrities who isnt crying over Hillary Clintons loss and doesnt feel that he needs to make his political opinions known. Hes simply doing what hes paid well to do and wishes others in the biz would too. Since they continue to throw tantrums and trash Trump on a public stage, Russell reached his breaking point and finally fired back hard. This is a business thats heavily promulgated by people who have a politically liberal bent, Russell began in his blistering beratement of these overpaid crybabies after what Streep said at the Golden Globes. I dont begrudge them that. Im a libertarian; frankly, I think my liberalness goes far beyond theirs in a lot of ways, he added, as reported by the American Lookout.

{"message": "According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had no value and were like ISIS, and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested. Advertisement The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans. Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76  $8,832.73 per month  according to public records. Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera has a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as n*ggers'. One of Nuceras officers made numerous recordings of Nucera that contained extremely offensive racist comments over the course of a year because he was alarmed by Nuceras racism, according to the affidavit. The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadnt paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police escalated into a physical struggle, that both teens resisted arrest and that one of the officers used pepper spray. Advertisement After both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-olds head and slammed it into the right side of the metal doorjamb, according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-olds head make a loud thud as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasnt resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had stopped walking for a moment to loudly complain. The use of force wasnt reported to the department. Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was f*cking tired of African-Americans. Ill tell you what, its gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers, Nucera allegedly said. And that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it, he said, referring to the 16-year-old girls aunt, who was present at the arrest. Fucking nipple hanging bitch. Im so tired of them, man. Nucera allegedly said that black people should stay the fuck out of Bordentown and referred to the 18-year-old as fucking little, fucking n****r. In a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to put my hands on him. These n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value, Nucera allegedly said. They should line them all up and mow em down. Id like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, Im tired of it. The conduct alleged is shocking, acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference. Its a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.

In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims. The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle. Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster  which is illegal in California  and put both men down in seconds. Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was extreme and unnecessary. The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release: Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both mens initial wounds were superficial. While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didnt denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull. Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasnt self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution. Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him hed get a medal from the Governor of California? DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California dont actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters. DeLisle hasnt asked for an appeal.

Probable cause ingredients for adverse reactions include: casein, to which some children are allergic; MSGan excitotoxin; thimerosal-ethyl mercury; aluminum; formaldehyde; gelatin; and polysorbate 80. You might be wondering: Why the doctors dont say anything about the risk of DTaP Vaccine? That is a question that many of us, still wondering! Maybe they just is just not convenient for them that we know about the risk of these vaccine To take the vaccine debacle further, most of the mandated vaccines for infants and children, contain many of the above ingredients, which must be stopped from being injected into infants, toddlers, teens and even adults! Its time for Congress to rescind the Get out of Jail Free card for vaccine makers and stop the aggressive onslaught of the Autism Spectrum Disorder that is depriving children of a fulfilling life and ruining families emotionally, financially, and physically to the point of parents divorcing because of the stresses of ASD in a family. Its about time vaccines are publicly acknowledged by the feds and the media for all the health damages they have caused. Just check out the CDCs VAERS reports and the vaccine damage payouts by the HHS/HRSA. According to a new report published on March 1, 2017, by the department of health and human services of the United States, about $ 3,363,282,409.21 have been paid for vaccine adverse reactions and deaths from 1989 to 2017 so far.

There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now. - It has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now. Rich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC. Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right. Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that. Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Richs murder. Wheeler said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. \"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming, said Wheeler. They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\" Wheeler also told us, \"I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I cant share any information with you. Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I dont think it comes from the chiefs office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday]. A full report with the new details will air Tuesday morning on FOX News.", "title": "Family's private investigator: There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to death", "label": "fake", "id": 285}
{"message": "Its absolutely clear that the Clinton Foundation has faced some honest reports of stealing from impoverished Haitians devastated in the 2008 Hurricane Hanna, and straight through their own foundation. For years the Haitians have been struggling and protesting outside the Clinton Foundation offices over the robbery. The money taken was donated by the individuals and business directly to the Clinton Foundation, thinking they were going to receive aid. However, the opposite it true. The money never even made it to the poorest of the poor. Now we have one man ready to testify against the corrupt Clinton Foundation in the upcoming week. However, the 50 year old man, a former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein, was found dead in his Miami home with a gunshot to the head thats been ruled a suicide by the Miami-Dades medical examiner records supervisor. Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50. Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors. Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundations activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the governments economic development agency, Fonds dassistance conomique et social, for three years. According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8%  or $5.4 billion  was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace, Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year. The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza  the Klaus Special  named after him. According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in good spirits, with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. Its really shocking, said Muncheezs owner Gilbert Bailly. We grew up together; he was like family. Your News Wire Americans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clintons dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clintons, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House. Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to side with the Clinton Administration and he would be the richest man in Haiti. He also demanded that Hillary Clinton disclose the audit of all money related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social networks efforts to combat fake news. We found no evidence that Bullock made the statement about Clinton. The same story has circulated on various websites on Facebook at least since October. While the headline showed Bullock bashing Clinton, the article itself didnt include any quotes by Bullock in which she mentioned Clinton or Trump by name. The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her \"new film,\" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. \"I dont agree with that at all,\" Bullock said. \"That was not a statement that I can get behind. I dont agree with that statement.\" The Flash 24 Daily article included some actual quotes by Bullock from that press conference about how her views are influenced by her son. Bullock has adopted two African-American children -- a boy and a girl. \"I would like my rights represented and those of my son  very selfish views, and I think everyone else has them,\" she says. \"When this film came along, it came along at a time that I was having that internal discussion with myself about who in our country would step out of their comfort zone to help others for the greater good.\" We found no evidence that Bullock said to Clinton \"if you dont like our president you can leave and never come back again.\" We rate this headline Pants on Fire.", "title": "No, Sandra Bullock didn't disparage Hillary Clinton", "label": "fake", "id": 291}

The schools chancellor, Malcolm Little, said that regardless of her status as a former first daughter, the rules are the rules and she wont be welcome there this fall. The stunning announcement came after Malia was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends. Harvard has a strict no drug policy. Massachusetts is one of the states that now allows for recreational marijuana and the hotel is weed friendly, but that doesnt change the fact that she broke the rules. Malias lawyer has pointed out that the school has turned the other way on the marijuana issue when their entire rowing team, made up of 14 white males, was caught selling and smoking marijuana cigarettes during the offseason. Chancellor Little remarked that the difference was that the members of the rowing team are hard-working, established students whose parents are paying cash for their education while Malia hasnt attended yet, isnt planning on playing a sport and is going to the school on a combination of a scholarship from the Clinton Foundation and taxpayer-funded grants.

{"message": "A sportsbook is a place where people go to make wagers on various sports and events. Typically, a bettors will put money on the outcome of a particular event and will receive a paper ticket that is redeemable for cash should their bet win. However, betting on sports is not without its risks and it is important for players to understand the risks involved before placing a bet. It is also important to manage ones bankroll and not bet more than they can afford to lose. There are many different ways to bet on sports and finding the right sportsbook for your needs is essential. The best way to do this is by reading independent reviews from reputable sources. You should also check the sportsbooks license status and ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. It is also a good idea to consult with an attorney who specializes in gambling law. While it is possible to find a sportsbook that offers all of the bells and whistles, you should also look for one that offers low minimum and maximum bet limits. This is especially important if you are new to betting on sports or are planning on placing multiple bets at once. A sportsbook that has these features will allow you to play responsibly and not get carried away with the excitement of winning or losing. In addition, you should always choose a sportsbook that accepts your preferred payment methods. This includes credit cards, traditional and electronic bank transfers and popular online transfer services like PayPal. This will help you avoid any problems with depositing and withdrawing funds. Another thing to keep in mind when choosing a sportsbook is its reputation. You want to be sure that youre working with a reputable company that treats its customers fairly and is committed to providing a positive customer experience. A reputable sportsbook will also have adequate security measures in place to protect your personal information and will pay out your winnings promptly and accurately. When youre shopping around for a sportsbook, its important to compare the odds offered by each site. This is because different sportsbooks will set their own odds for a given game and the differences can be significant. For example, a Chicago Cubs game may be -180 at one sportsbook but -190 at another. While the difference in odds is small, it can still affect your total profit. When youre ready to start your own sportsbook, you should first consider what your budget is. This will determine how big or small you can build your sportsbook and what features it will offer. Some people choose to use turnkey solutions, but this can be expensive and can limit your options for customization. In addition, its important to remember that sportsbook margins are razor thin so any extra expenses can really hurt your profits. Therefore, its best to work with a custom sportsbook development solution that will give you full control over your product and allow you to adapt to any market.", "title": "Just another WordPress site", "label": "fake", "id": 294}

The news, just picked up for a special edition of Hannity tomorrow, could unravel the evil empire once and for all. His name is Wilshire Williams  or at least thats the alias hes used for more than 40 years. He was a low-level runner for the mafia until he was literally sold to Bill Clinton in exchange for 12 cases of confiscated Arkansas moonshine. Clinton was the State Attorney at the time. He and Williams, who was born Terrence Wilekenmeyer in Yonkers, became close. Williams, who knows that while he was invited to their barbeques and kept comfortable and out of the spotlight for 40 years he was nothing but a tool, says that he is dying of pancreatic cancer and that he needs to go with a clean conscience. The intern at Fox that took the interview for Hannity told our reporter: Wilekenmeyer is the real deal. He put three bullets in Vince Foster and two in Seth Rich. He tied up more loose ends than any other hitman in history. The interview with Williams, which should tape in the next day or two, will be pre-empted by a short radio interview on Hannitys show tomorrow. Wilekenmeyer has cooperated with authorities and will not be arrested until after his stories can all be corroborated, which wont be nearly fast enough to beat the cancer riddling his body. Doctors say he has less than a week to live. Hopefully, all of the evidence this man says he has pans out and a dying declaration is enough.

{"message": "David Hogg, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, knows what gunshots sound like: His father worked in law enforcement, and taught him about weapons and how to handle them. So when Hogg heard a pop while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he told his teacher it sounded strangely like a gunshot. But there had been a fire drill that very morning and talk of a Code Red exercise to prepare for an active shooter. This must just be a surprise drill, he reasoned. And then the fire alarm sounded. Dutifully acting on it, Hogg and other students tried to exit the building. A janitorHogg doesnt know his name but calls him an angelknew where the shots were coming from and sent the students back. Then a culinary arts teacher, Ashley Kurth, pulled Hogg and others inside, locked the door, and made them hide in a closet. Checking Twitter and Instagram, Hoggwhos an editor at the schools TV stationfound the news that the shooting was real and ongoing. The shots continued for what felt like an eternity. Hogg considered the possibility that he would not live to see the end of the day. While I was in there, I thought, What impact have I had? What will my story be if I die here? Hogg told TIME in the hours following the ordeal. And the only thing I could think of was, pull out my camera and try telling others. As a student journalist, as an aspiring journalist, thats all I could think: Get other peoples stories on tape. If we all die, the camera survives, and thats how we get the message out there, about how we want change to be brought about. In the wake of Wednesdays mass shooting, in which at least 17 were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, that cry for change is echoing across this normally quiet, almost bucolic Florida community of 30,000 on the edge of the Everglades, which draws residents seeking sprawling homes and room to run horses. Its being heard across Broward County, whose sheriff, Scott Israel, is prodding Florida officials to provide more funding for mental health, as well as laws that would prevent a person with psychological problems from being able to legally acquire a gun. And its becoming a rallying cry for people here and across the U.S. who are wondering what, if anything, changes from one mass shooting to the next. When do we say, thats not acceptable, something has to change? asked Hogg, 17, his voice breaking. Hoggs sister Lauren, a freshman at the high school, is fearing the worst: one of her friends had still not been located late Thursday. Nikolas Cruz, the suspect who has been charged with 17 counts of murder, had been expelled from the school a year ago and appears to have targeted a building full of ninth-graders. RELATED VIDEO: Florida Shooting Survivor Calls for Action Will Gilroy is one of the freshmen who escaped the gunmans wrath. He is still waiting for word about classmates that havent been located. Like Hogg, Gilroy thought the shooting wasnt real at first. But then he heard the sirens. He listened to his teachers orders and crowded into a closet with about 20 others. He was in there, he says, for about an hour. It was hot in there. We were packed in tight, he told TIME. Some students were crying. The teacher had paper plates and we used them to fan ourselves. Inside the closet Gilroy began texting with his mother, Kristi Gilroy, who teaches second and third grade in at Country Hills Elementary just down the road. She too was on lockdown, with kids who stayed for after-school ccare. She was relieved to know her only son was alive. But the shooter was still at large. Cruz was eventually caught just down the road from their house, trying to escape with the rest of the crowd. My husband is ex-military, so its not like were anti-gun. But an AR-15? Kristi Gilroy said. You tell me, how big of a gun does a person need? Douglas is closed for the rest of the week as teens and teachers struggle to make sense of the carnage. But Kristi Gilroy faces the difficult job of going back to school Thursday, waiting for news of the dead and injured, which might, she feared, include children shed taught when they were younger. The usual questions arose Thursday about whether it was too soon to talk about gun control. Some local officials seemed ready to toss out the oft-heard script, the prayers for families and praise for first responders. Now, now is the time for this country to have a conversation about sensible gun control laws in this country, Broward County School Superintendent Robert W. Runcie told reporters. Our students are asking for that. President Trump spoke Thursday morning, taking on the grim task of comforter-in-chief, but offering no specific proposals. To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you, whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain, Trump said. We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also. Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that shed been sitting with parents until 3:30 a.m. Having to tell parents that a child, 14 years old, is dead, is the hardest thing you have to do in your career, she said, her eyes full of tears. To some, however, words of comfort wont be enough. When do we actually stand up? I think its the time that we all stand up, Hogg demanded. If you dont call your Congressman and do it again and again and not give up, its going to be your child thats next. And thats horrifying. Meanwhile, Parkland waits. Waits for the names of the innocent who were gunned down before they could graduate, or in some cases, finish the ninth grade. Waits for news of funeral arrangements for a beloved football coach and security guard. Waits to hear if the children still in the hospital pull will through. Waits for someone to convince their teenagers that its okay to go back to school, that theyre safe, and that nothing like this will happen again.

{"message": "On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has sanctioned violence, as long it protects the people favorable to the Obama position, politically. She insisted that the president is sending a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Dont attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted. She also linked the Obama administrations lawlessness to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving normal people helpless in the face of anarchy. And these days it has become so obvious that Im honestly surprised were not having riots throughout the country, she said. When did this become a nation of criminals? I didnt get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. Im not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America. The ex-Rep. then argued that not even slaves suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. Its true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, Im not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear  were supposed to be all evolved right now, were supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? Hes protecting those who want to hurt white people, as youve seen in Minneapolis. In fact, Bachmann continued firing, I dont think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to whats been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obamas presidency.

{"message": "The guest list hasnt been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite. But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, Were focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement, adding that invitations will be announced in due course. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Mark Blinch/Reuters When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesnt require as extensive a security detail as he once did. If Trump were to appear at Prince Harrys wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure. Instead of a state visit, Trumps trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a working trip where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go one better than Obamas state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated. A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case. The defense teams April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange. When the defense counsel asked K.S., Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone? she answered: Not to my knowledge. I didnt see him with it. The question was then asked, And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera  with a camera or a phone? K.S. replied, Correct. The counsel then asked, And you cant say you saw it on his person, you cant say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not? K.S. answered, Yes. I cannot say. Trying to salvage the states case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., Did you see what you believed to be a phone? Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered,  I havent talked about it because I dont know if its because Im remembering it through a dream or I  Im not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I havent spoken about it because of that. K.S. remembered the photo incident through a dream? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case. As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens. Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.", "title": "Breaking: Greitens Accuser Admits Photo Session May Have Been A Dream", "label": "fake", "id": 302}

{"message": "An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall. Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, said he didnt want to take sides in the gun-control debate consuming the country. If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before. Jacob had met with the schools principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting. But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the students to express themselves. COLLEGE STUDENT KICKED OUT OF CLASS FOR TELLING PROFESSOR THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS This left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control. He decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door. When they returned, he was slapped with a suspension. Jacobs father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral  and did nothing wrong. Politics [doesnt] belong in the school, he said.

Canadian tourist, John OKeef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake. We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head explains OKeef. Id heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself, claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist. The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts. Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: This is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region. he admits, visibly puzzled. It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes, he told reporters. According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time. U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the regions waters is highly unlikely as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems. In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.", "title": "3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "label": "fake", "id": 310}

{"message": "2.9k SHARES Share Tweet In his rally in Pensylvania this past Saturday night President Trump made an interesting comment about First Lady Melania Trump. The president mentioned the very first woman in the context of her role within his administrations work in combating the opioid catastrophe and discussing blue ribbon study committees. To which he added that shes a great first lady but her life isnt simple. It was a nice touch that the president mentioned the very first Lady since theres been so much scrutiny in their union lately. Especially since the porn star Stormy Daniel is obviously trying to take attention off Donald and Melanias strong marriage by placing it on her herself along with her sick affair asserts she has since recanted, but nevertheless wont quit speaking about. Daniels is making Melania look bad and the first woman is getting revenge by never giving into her attention-seeking ways with any reaction or attack, which the pornography celebrity probably wants considering shes probably doing all of this for monetary gain and a wonderful book deal. After all, it has to be hard being a washed-up porn star that will never be as well respected, well known, well liked and rich since Melania is. Melania is keeping her class and elegance before the world in a very rough time. While at precisely the same time also showing shes human and relatable by recognizing lifestyle is not so simple. Thats a fact and leaves her relatable to us ordinary folk, it is not weakness, so it may very well be her greatest strength and the reason a lot people adore and respect her. Not sure youll be able to find 1 person who admires and would like to become Stormy Daniels. Stormy, go crawl back into the cave you came out, no one here is interested in the accusations you are making which allegedly happened over a decade ago. Via CBS News: It had been over a decade back from 2006 that, according to a Wall Street Journal expose published last week, porn celebrity Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, stated shed slept with billionaire Apprentice host Donald Trump. But outlets were chasing the story seemingly long before that. InTouch magazine Wednesday released a seven-year-old interview with Clifford, in which she states shed recurring sexual experiences with Mr. Trump after meeting him in July 2006. Whether you are a lover of his or not, which I never really was, you gotta admit he is pretty fascinating, Clifford said in the 2011 interview that the magazine published Wednesday. We had really great banter. He told me that I was a person to be reckoned with, smart and beautiful just like his daughter. Its unclear with the publication didnt operate with the interview at the time. Jacob Weisberg, editor-in-chief of Slate, wrote an article in his book before this week also saying he spoke with Clifford about the alleged tryst at the moment, and between August and October 2016, before the election, the porn star was prepared to take her story people. An old acquaintance of his in California was near a girl from the adult-film business who claimed to have had an affair with Donald Trump. I reached my friends buddy, who placed me in touch with the celebrity, whos called Stormy Daniels. Danielsdid really have a narrative about Trump, which she related to me in a series of phone conversations and text exchanges that took place between August and October of 2016. Three of Cliffords friends told Weisberg that they were conscious of the alleged affair at that time. Weisberg also published the screenshot of an unsigned document Clifford allegedly sent to him 2016. Clifford was worried Mr. Trump would not cover, and she wished to be reimbursed somehow if she talked out instead, Weisberg wrote. Then, Weisberg said she stopped responding to his efforts at communication. He never published anything regarding the claims before the election. Given what was going on in the final weeks of the campaign, during which Trump was facing a torrent of accusations of sexual abuse, I didnt believe an extramarital affair could be a highly significant story, Weisberg wrote. More specifically, she said her attorney Keith Davidson, a Beverly Hillsbased lawyer who specializes in claims against celebrities, had exercised the conditions with Trumps lawyer Michael Cohen. Slate wasnt the only book pursuing the story. A Fox News reporter, according to a CNN report, was also pursuing the story about the alleged event. Fox News writer Diana Falzone in October 2016 allegedly filed a story that included an on-the-record announcement from Cliffords supervisor at the time confirming the alleged event, also Falzone had viewed emails talking a settlement. However, Fox News shelved the narrative, according to the CNN report. Clifford a week denied the affair asserts in a statement provided to CBS News. To whom it may concern, I recently became aware that certain news outlets have been alleging that I had a sexual or romantic affair with Donald Trump guy, many, many years ago. I am stating with complete consent that this is totally false. The buzz about Stormy Daniels  she was trending on Twitter Friday  has seemingly died down as fast as it came.

He has been for over a decade. Each and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team. This long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss. While this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma. Its a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...? William asking Rio.

The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word, There were no judges, no charges no trialjust belief. His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18  teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught  and he wanted to attack this loophole. Why dont we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle? Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held  248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states. Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they dont want the kids going to jail with their parents. Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in facilities so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels. Our concern is that the programs real intent is to interrogate the kids, said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them. While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyers written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relatives son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border. But the program was a surprise to Mexico The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasnt an announcement, said Reyna Torres Mendvil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministrys office for protection of Mexicans abroad. Where were they taking these children? Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican. Below is a video of an Illegal Immigrant child detention center published in July 2014.  Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process. illegal immigrants illegal immigrants illegal immigrants", "title": "Obama Administration Kept Illegal Mexican Kids In Detention Camps As Experiment", "label": "fake", "id": 320}

The ranch, just a few hundred miles north of anything in Wyoming, was also seized along with a fleet of automobiles, recreational vehicles and other property now considered the spoils of the drug trade. The bust itself yielded more than $6 million in finished drugs alone, never mind the plants and raw product waiting for packaging. All in all, Senator Lindsay is looking at 70 years behind bars on the opium alone. He was taken into custody at his office in Washington DC and has since been booked and released on $10 million bail. Lindsays office isnt commenting on the ordeal but New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has already called for his removal and a special election as soon as possible.

{"message": "One of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lords name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain (Exodus 20:7). The word vain means for no reason or useless. Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written Gods name was holy and should not be used for regular words. Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should. Saying the Lords name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America, Hagee elaborated. But, thats precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I dont think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself. The pastor reprimanded: But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places. Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: Well, wed have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If youre asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using Gods name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lords name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of Gods wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Makers good name./religionlo.com/ Comments comments", "title": "John Hagee Calls For Prosecuting Women Who Say Gods Name During Intercourse", "label": "fake", "id": 324}
{"message": "Fox News host Sandra Smith on Wednesday linked a customer who was dragged off a United Airlines flight to government overregulation of the airline industry. During a Fox News discussion about the recent United Airlines public relations debacle, Smith noted that lawmakers were calling for an investigation and that the airline lost millions in stock value. Airlines disgust me, Fox News contributor Geraldo Rivera told Smith. They do everything to maximize profit. Theres nothing wrong with maximizing profit, Smith insisted. Thats what theyre supposed to do as a publicly traded airline. But when you book and overbook, Rivera replied, paid passengers have to give up their seats. This is not business. This is reckless, foolhardy imposition of your own personal convenience  what happened to the customer is always right? Smith continued, But look, I get where youre coming from with this, but at the end of the day, were talking here about an airline, a company that exists solely for the purpose of transporting passengers from one place in the country to another. If you just consider the fact that 15 or so years ago we had two airplanes crash into the World Trade Center in New York City, I think youll understand that they were right to be edgy. And that goes especially in a situation in which the passenger in question was not a genuine American. As a matter of fact, if you take a look at the video of what happened on the plane, its obvious that his behavior suggests that hes from another part of the world, and thats that. Rivera asked, You cant possibly be serious, Sandra? Are you actually saying that the company was right to, first, overbook the flight, and then secondly, call security to beat up the man simple because his behavior suggested he wasnt a true American? And what does that even mean? Again, Smith wouldnt be confused. Look Geraldo, at the end of the day, you have to understand the fact that the moment Americans see a non-white person sitting next to them on a plane, they get chills. Some of them get outright angry as well, and while thats not ideal, its certainly understandable. We cant blame people for fearing for their lives because of the terrible tragedy this country endured during 9/11. Whats more, I would even go so far as to say that the man had it coming for one simple reason. If that had been a white person, they would have likely stepped out of the plane and waited for the next flight, not to mention that they would probably also have been compensated for the inconvenience in some way or another. Instead, since this guy wasnt white, his reaction was also different from that of a white person, which is why he refused to give up his seat. If hed done that, everything would have gone more smoothly and without incident. This way, because he was stubborn, he ended up getting the short end of the stick. Thats just not how white people behave, and non-whites in this country need to learn that. Were more civilized than the rest, which is why were at the top of the food chain.

Representative Eric Swalwell from Californias 15th District wrote that all so-called assault weapons need to be banned, and that a federal gun buy-back program needs to be instituted in order to effectively collect them all from the citizenry. Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their assault weapons be criminally prosecuted  including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry. Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new assault weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary. Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed, Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come. Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.

Now the state of California has appointed its first unprotected illegal alien in state office after Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Len (D-Los Angeles) appointed Lizbeth Mateo an advisory committee. The committees formal name is a bureaucratic mouthful  the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, or Cal-SOAP, for short  but its mission is one that will be familiar to Mateo: to find ways to help students from underserved communities go to college Mateo is aa 33-year-old attorney and civil rights activist who was born in Mexico and came to the United States illegally at the age of 14 with her parents, who are also illegal aliens, according to the Sacramento Bee. She often complains that illegal aliens are treated unjustly and are not adequately represented in state government. As a result, she describes her appointment as a means towards correcting that alleged injustice. Mateo said via Fox News  While undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made. Trending: Melania Just Fired Them ALL! That Is Not Acceptable Here  I Wont Allow It! Senate Bill 174 made Mateos appointment possible by amending existing state law to allow the appointment of any resident over the age of 18 to a civil office regardless of citizenship or immigration status. California law currently states that someone is incapable of holding office if they are not a citizen at the time of their appointment. California is stronger when we utilize talents of all our residents, and opening state and local boards and commissions to every Californian will allow us to better serve our diverse communities, Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, and the bills author said in a statement. Undocumented Californians are our neighbors, co-workers, and parents, and as lawmakers, we cant make good policy if their voices are left out of the discussion. It marked the first time the Senate appointed someone living within the borders of the United States illegally to a state post. De Lens office attempted to make the argument that the appointment was perfectly legal because Mateos committee is advisory in nature only and not delegated to adopt laws and regulations or allocate state funds.

If she misses it so much? Why does she not return? After all, it is her homeland and the country of which is she is a citizen. Yet here she is in America, in a country in which her very presence is in defiance of the law she swears to uphold both as an attorney and officer of the court, and also as an officer of the California state government. It is important to note that while Mateo is the first unprotected illegal alien to hold a state office, she is not the first elevated to public office in California. In 2015, the city council of Huntington Park, California, appointed two illegal aliens to city commissions, sparking a public backlash. De Len and other state officials are stoking an ongoing confrontation with the federal government over federal immigration laws. Many were also quick to point out Mateos hypocrisy in her chosen profession in the law and in government with her own illegal status and refusal to adhere federal immigration law.

{"message": "Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants, saying their safety should take precedence over national security concerns and that they should not be subjected to collective deportations. His challenge to politicians, made in a comprehensive position paper on migrants and refugees, again appeared to put him at odds with the restrictive policies of a number of governments dealing with growing popular anti-immigrant sentiment. Solidarity must be concretely expressed at every stage of the migratory experience  from departure through journey to arrival and return, he said in a message ahead of the Roman Catholic Churchs World Day of Migrants and Refugees. Calling for broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally, he said the human rights and dignity of all migrants had to be respected regardless of their legal status. The principle of the centrality of the human person  obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security, he said. This appeared to be a reference to fears voiced in many European countries that refugees inflows could lead to security problems in their host countries. He said it was necessary to ensure that agents in charge of border control are properly trained. He called for alternative solutions to detention for illegal immigrants and said collective and arbitrary expulsions of migrants and refugees are not suitable solutions. Francis said migrants should be seen as a true resource for the communities that welcome them and be given freedom of movement, access to means of communication, access to justice and everyday rights such as opening a bank account. Francis, an Argentine who has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, has criticized anti-immigrant stands by national leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. Last year, Francis condemned then-candidate Trumps intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Migrant children deserved particular protection, the pope said. They must be spared any form of detention related to migratory status, guaranteed access to primary and secondary education and have the right to remain when they come of age. Franciss message immediately drew the ire of the right-wing Northern League party in Italy because it implicitly supported a controversial law proposal that would grant citizenship to children who are born in Italy of immigrant parents.

{"message": "A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell. He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials. From Fox News: Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Irans parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the countrys Etemad newspaper, cited by the countrys Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme. Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament. While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point. When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians, he claimed. If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America. The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khameneis inner circle, added: It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency. He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. against our national interests. Its not clear who hes talking about and whether hes confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account. But it obviously raises a concerning question. There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldnt be hard to believe. And it shouldnt be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation. The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you cant get a straight answer. Asked about the clerics claim, a State Department spokesperson said: Were not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official. Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian officials allegation. This sounds like totally made up BS, she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment. This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal. And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehrans elite. Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S., Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades. Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: Iranians dont understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials. The protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didnt feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran. Theres a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here. But it could be interesting if its the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.", "title": "Iranian Official Drops Bombshell: Obama Secretly Gave Citizenship to 2500 Iranians as Part of Nuke Deal", "label": "fake", "id": 334}

{"message": "Four million people dropped off the food stamp rolls in one month, according to the latest numbers on food stamp enrollment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The latest USDA data show that the number of participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the government program that administers food stamps, dropped from 45,666,795 in October 2017 to 41,658,868 in November 2017  a staggering decrease of 4,007,927 over one month. Even though there was a temporary spike in enrollment, mostly concentrated in a few states that caused the national average of food stamp enrollment to spike, nationwide enrollment in the program as a whole is still on a steady decline. Enrollment in the program sharply increased by 3.5 million during the first month of fiscal year (FY) 2018 (October 2017) mostly due to heavy increases in temporary SNAP enrollment in hurricane-affected states such as Florida and Texas. In Florida alone, food stamp participation soared by 2.5 million from September to October due to the state administering Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) benefits to poor residents affected by Hurricane Irma. The USDAs Food and Nutrition Service approved Floridas request to administer these special D-SNAP benefits beginning September 10, 2017. A spokesperson for Floridas Department of Children and Families (DCF)  the program that administers food stamp benefits in Florida  confirmed with Breitbart News that the dramatic increase in SNAP enrollment in the state was due to disaster relief, but that most food stamp recipients were not normal beneficiaries of the food stamp program. The dramatic increase in SNAP recipients in the fall was related to the states administration of the federal disaster SNAP program following the impact of Hurricane Irma. To qualify for the federal disaster food assistance program, individuals must have lived or worked in one of the 48 declared counties on September 5, and NOT be a customer in the regular food assistance program, said DCF Communications Director Jessica Sims. Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3. The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters. But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce. The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures  such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week  and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further. Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million. The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year  and every year after 2013  is continuing.", "title": "Food Stamp Enrollment Drops by Four Million in One Month", "label": "fake", "id": 341}

{"message": "COSTA MESA, Orange County  It was a surreal visit to Rep. Dana Rohrabachers Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10. Then again, Ronald Reagans 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. Hes a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that Putin pays him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were a total hoax. Hes both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that probably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops. During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called Individual Man. If youre a Democrat, youre thinking, How is this guy still holding office in California? Standing at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. Theyre focused on districts like Rohrabachers, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch. It wont be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin-the-Gipper part of the OC. Hes run for Congress 15 times, and hes won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but hes conservative OC kind of fringe-y. Thats why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said hes not worried about Dana at all. And it doesnt hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District. Still, Rohrabacher acknowledges, this race will be the toughest. Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, of Russia. Now Playing: Rohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the high confidence with which the nations top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election? Total bull, Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches  his favorite meal  that he slapped together in his kitchen. Ive read those reports and theyre full of weasel words. That story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election, he said. One of Rohrabachers sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England. Rohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasnt involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didnt say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpas neighborhood. Rohrabacher isnt buying that conspiracy theory, but hes deep into another  that Democrats were behind last months white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said. Its all baloney, Rohrabacher said. Under Rohrabachers scenario, a former Hillary and Bernie supporter got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there. It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors, Rohrabacher said. It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation and to put our president on the spot. Those of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of Info Wars, will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is Pants on Fire groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact. Meanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC. Plus, theres an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabachers office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman  and not in a good way. People saw incumbent and an R by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values, said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. Dana Rohrabacher doesnt support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me We didnt realize he was this unhinged. Rohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets. But he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone. And that is what is making Rohrabacher do something hes rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. Hes seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign  so far hes raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.

{"message": "Following the recent resignation of Director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub Jr., the Trump Administration has unexpectedly accepted another resignation: White House Chef Lisa Mead. Mead reportedly decided to resign because President Donald Trump hasnt utilized her culinary talents even once the entire time he has been living in the White House. Its kind of crazy because Lisa is such a good chef, said Kurt Reno, the White House aide who recommended Ms. Mead for the job. But Lisa feels insulted because the President has ordered fast food for literally every single meal hes eaten in D.C. The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trumps orders from drive-through windows and scoop the Presidents ice cream from the carton. Mr. Trumps favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the Presidents eating habits to the press. Its borderline creepy, the staffer said. The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like hes dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. Its gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something. Mr. Trumps McDonalds habits are even weirder. He orders the same thing every time, said the staffer. He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M and M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M and M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M and Ms. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.

The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One Deal released on Friday. THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up. Unlike the leak with Manafort and his indictment (which had nothing to do with Russian collusion in the Trump campaign), America woke up to non-stop news about Manafort turning himself in. Click HERE to read more about that. Manafort has since sued Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Fast forward to today. Uranium One Deal has its FIRST INDICTMENT against Mark Lambert. Mark Lambert of Maryland has been indicted for allegedly paid bribes to a Russian Official so his Company could win highly sensitive nuclear fuel transportation contracts. The 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. This is serious. And it stems from Russian collusion in the Obama-era. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russias State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. KUDOS to the Trump-era DOJ Americans can trust. The hard working and honest DOJ team, under Jeff Sessions, made the announcement yesterday. The team members are: Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBIs Washington, D.C. Field Office, as mentioned in the DOJ statement. Here is the Statement Below: An indictment against a former co-president of a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was unsealed today for his alleged role in a scheme that involved the bribery of an official at a subsidiary of Russias State Atomic Energy Corporation. Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departments Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen M. Schenning of the District of Maryland, Principal Deputy Inspector General April G. Stephenson of the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Andew W. Vale of the FBIs Washington, D.C. Field Office made the announcement. Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russias State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. The case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland. According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at Transportation Corporation A to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX. In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like lucky figures, LF, lucky numbers, and cake to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T he indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation As services. In June 2015, Lamberts former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing. The indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.

{"message": "ELDER PATRIOT  New evidence has been uncovered by a private investigator that proves Jim Comey was a dirty cop who had to go. After former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered his family asked people to stop speculating about his involvements and to respect their privacy. At the time many of us connected the Wikileaks revelations to his death and concluded he was killed to send a message to other would be leakers by people within the DNC or from within the Clinton campaign. Of course we were dismissed as conspiracy theorists. Now it has been reported that former D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler had been hired by Richs family to run a parallel investigation to the one being conducted by the F.B.I. Both the D.C. police and the F.B.I. had been involved but Wheeler revealed that neither, The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They havent been cooperating at all. Wheeler also confirmed that his sources have told him that absolutely there is information on Richs laptop that links Rich to Wikileaks. Wheeler also was told by his source inside the D.C. Police Department, Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I cant share any information with you. According to Wheeler, That is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I dont think it comes from the chiefs office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayors office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out. [Tuesday]. Its apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Richs laptop and the agencys director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillarys campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three. Comeys contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks. In explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comeys claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards. Hector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said: Attribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here. Its nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere. Also, they are aware of techniques to track them down. So you could have an Egyptian hacker who uses Russian software so it looks like its Russian but is actually from Egypt. Comey was definitive that Russia had hacked the DNCs computers with the intention of helping Donald Trump get elected. Heres what weve learned since Comey made that declaration to congress: The F.B.I. never did a forensic examination of the DNC servers. Instead they took the word of the company the DNC hired to look into it. Experts, ones who worked for the F.B.I., admit that attribution is nearly impossible even if you are in possession of the computers that were hacked. Comey concluded that Hillary Clinton did not intend to commit espionage despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary but that the Russians intended to help Donald Trump without presenting a single shred of evidence that the Russians were even involved. Revelations such as this continue to surface. They are the reason that former Federal Prosecutor Joseph DiGenova said of Comey, hes a dirty cop. Watch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com Comey had to go and President Trump did the right thing in firing him. Contrary to the talking points coming out of the D.C. swamp, Trump gave Comey every opportunity to prove his fealty to the law once he had been freed from the constraints put on him by Obama and Loretta Lynch. When Comey continued protecting known criminal behavior to save the swamp he left Donald Trump no choice but to fire him. America deserves an F.B.I. director who is determined to prosecute criminal behavior no matter where he finds it.", "title": "BOMBSHELL: COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE  and  COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY", "label": "fake", "id": 352}

Sir Meyer, who is the former UK Ambassador to the United States, was targetted after he publically expressed his support for Donald Trump's visit. The retired diplomat was left with a bleeding and swollen eye socket, a burst lip and a possible broken nose. Violent riots have gripped the nation's capital as citizens take to the streets in a shameful display of fascism and intolerance. Meyer's wife, Baroness Catherine Meyer, has expressed her anger at the brutal attack, saying it \"was politically motivated,\" adding: \"It's just not right.\" \"I'm absolutely shocked by the level of the brutality. They really beat him. It's appalling  like something you would see in a war zone,\" she said. He looks terrible,\" she continues. \"His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken. He hasnt had an x-ray yet. \"He doesnt remember anything. \"The first thing he remembers is the police. He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions. Nothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly. \"London is such a beautiful, wonderful city. \"We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.\"  press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political view Daily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador. He spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945. As ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. After retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body. He is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs. The former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today. He has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years. Sir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared. Since the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital. Forces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months. A statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said: \"Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted. \"A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. \"They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue. \"A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.\" Thoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday.

{"message": "Televangelist Pat Robertson recently repeated his prediction that LGBT rights will provoke God to destroy Americas financial markets, warning The 700 Club viewers that Gods wrath is on its way. He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution and cities like Houston are trying to force women to go into mens bathrooms and men to go into womens bathrooms. Now its a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other, he lamented, warning that the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff. He explained: I dont want the wrath of God to hit this country, its a great country, Id like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, were going to have this financial collapse. Were setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country thats probably the way hed do it. At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people. I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. Im thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach, Robertson opined. The viewer then interrupted The 700 Club host to state that that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II, referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame. I dont believe that, Robertson quickly became defensive. I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here? the host asked the caller. I do, the caller replied. But I also understand that youre trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago.

{"message": "A dispute in Angela Merkels coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship. The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leaders own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellors fate, possibly as soon as Monday. Horst Seehofer, Merkels interior minister and the leader of Bavarias Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continents struggle with migration. Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios: Compromise The two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers. Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader. No Compromise In the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. Thats when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkels rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, its hard to see how the coalition continues. Even if it doesnt come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious. Confidence vote For a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own partys votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats. Germanys Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. Its a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections. Merkel resigns Should the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germanys ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election. Split on the right The CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-rights Bavarian chapter  the CDU operates in all of Germanys 16 states except Bavaria. So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSUs position. A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkels chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. We should all remain calm, he said.", "title": "BREAKING: Shep Smith To Be Canned Because He Cant Control His Hate For Donald Trump", "label": "fake", "id": 359}

NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot said western ice sheet collapse is unstoppable and could dramatically raise sea levels. Mantle Plumes are rivers of thin or melted rock that makes its way up towards earths surface and heats the crust above it, creating lakes and rivers of melted water underneath the massive ice sheet. Seroussis study showed a mantle plume pushes 150 milliwatts per square meter of heat up towards the ice sheet. Thats about two to three times the heat flux of regions of the world without volcanic activity. A 2014 University of Texas study found western Antarctica was a literal hotbed for geothermal heat.

While horse meat, technically, cant be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat. Where do these horses come from? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obamas watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations. Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico  and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well. Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore. Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses. Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner.

{"message": "318 SHARES Share Tweet President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. Thats called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we dont want migrants who cant fend for themselves. Maybe its better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. Its as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. Its like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe whats happening in Germany, with Merkels come on in policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? Theres already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then thats a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy, he stated on his weekly radio address. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who cant speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers  and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job  but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to journalist Chris Menahan.They said back in July only 55 out of one million migrants had got jobs with any major firms and 50 of those jobs were working at the post office, he reported. Two-thirds or more of these migrants are illiterate in their own languages.They came because Merkel promised them free money if they can just make it into the country.What in tarnation would be a good reason for any country to accept illiterate people who dont work? There is literally no benefit to the host country to admit people like that. I know it sounds mean to say this, but they dont offer anything to the country other than leeching the system of funds and its a complete downgrade to the population. If you let too many low illiterate people into the country, then they have kids who could be illiterate, then over time, it would only decrease the overall intelligence of the country and civilization in America would suffer. We need hard working and intelligent people who bring promise and productivity to further the advancement of Americans and mankind. That sounds like quite a stretch but think of the impact of accepting one million people who mostly cant read or dont work.Now the government has to pay for them.Lets say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. Thats $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all. That is literally a $0.00 return on investment. Not that people are a business, but thats really bad business.

{"message": "A man has been arrested and charged with murder after a car rammed into a group of people peacefully protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one person and injuring 19. Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details. Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday. James Fields was charged with second-degree murder. Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death, Kumer said in an email. Donald Trump condemned the violence on many sides, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators. In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville. State police said in a statement the helicopter was assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene. The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee. Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it. 00:01:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis  video The photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up. Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will  go home. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: Go home  Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot. The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didnt know it was a white supremacist rally. I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trumps not a white supremacist, Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally He had an African-American friend , she said before her voice trailed off. Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a terror attack by white supremacists. The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice departments civil rights division and the district attorneys office. The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated. WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally    NBC News (@NBCNews) August 12, 2017 The car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The citys decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the alt-right and the Ku Klux Klan. Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the Unite the Right event. One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities. Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today, said Spencer. We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves. He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: Jew! Jew! Jew! Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: If you take my picture, Ill cut you. Im not even kidding. Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people. A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: Were here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin. Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administrations politics and rhetoric. Statue controversy In February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant. It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina. In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klans departure, and made 23 arrests.

{"message": "An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in New York City hours after telling reporters that Super Bowl LII is rigged. Dan Goodes was found dead in his hometown of New York City in what early reports described as an gangland-style execution, hours after blowing the whistle on the rigged Super Bowl backstage at a promotional event in Minneapolis. Early reports claim the 49-year-old was found shot dead in a 2017 BMW 2 Series, along with one other man, believed to be a close friend. Goodes, an entertainment lawyer who worked at the National Football Leagues Park Avenue headquarters, had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis, working alongside Eagles and Patriots franchise staff on promoting Sundays Super Bowl featuring the two teams. However Goodes went off-script in Minneapolis and was physically removed from the premises by security staff, but not before publicly condemning the NFL as totally corrupt and claiming the Super Bowl is fixed. Telling reporters that he is a football fan first and foremost, and a lawyer second, Goodes said Football in America in 2018 doesnt need another rigged Super Bowl. We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesnt pass the sniff test. I like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I cant stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me wont allow it. Football in America wont recover from this. Early reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an gangland-style execution in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story. According to Goodes, the NFL have organized a rigged game that will earn maximum revenue for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth. This is the biggest scam in sports history, Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. The Super Bowl is already completely scripted out. How do I know its scripted? Ive read the damn thing. You need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes cant be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they dont care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesnt matter to the franchise owners. It doesnt matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here. The sad thing is that its legal. Can you believe that? Its legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me. Explaining that the NFL is officially registered as entertainment, Goodes said The NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine. The NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as entertainment rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate franchises they would want you to believe. In a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing entertainment in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws. The only other sport that occupies this legal position is the WWE. How are games rigged? According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system. Have you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesnt happen. Are they that good? Hell, no theyre not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed? Refs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? Im telling you now, they dont care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes? The players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes. How come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games? Everyone is on the same side, thats why. These NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They cant open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast. Why doesnt anyone speak out? According to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear. Remember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed. It is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl. And the NFL admitted it themselves in court. We are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. Were exempt. Super Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.", "title": "NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is Rigged, Found Dead", "label": "fake", "id": 368}

{"message": "The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Foxs Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors. Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the companys actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and running Mall of America into the ground, on the basis of Santa always having been white in the Bible. No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong, Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was the last straw in corporate Americas twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, because they realized they couldnt make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques theyve been using so far. She added, Thats why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they wont shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I dont understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that. Thats why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again, Palin added. The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we dont, if we let them get away with it, whats next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, were going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think thats happening by accident? Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups.

{"message": "Denzels recent comments about the Orwellian Police State is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administrations treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trumps Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Muellers Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo. Denzel affirmed, If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it! Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film Roman J. Israel, Esq. (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didnt pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections. When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was reliable, he responded, Hell yeah, its reliable. We dont need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly whats happened here. We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton. You guys cant see what is wrong with this? Youre kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign? Denzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output. Denzel continued, I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But youve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State. We couldnt agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didnt constitute complete treason? The double standards are oh so apparent, and its good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.", "title": "Denzel Washington: With Trump we avoided war with Russia and Orwellian Police State -", "label": "fake", "id": 372}
{"message": "De Soto, Missouri  Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when they found the remains of their child cooked in the microwave. According to police report, the young parents, were out at the movies before they came back home to find a confused babysitter under the influence of alcohol and crystal meth who had lost consciousness and was covered in blood in the familys living room. Moments later, the parents made the gruesome discovery when the young mother saw something moving in microwave. The 16-year-old babysitter named Anna Ritchie, claims she had brought some crystal meth and only took a few hits before she became hungry and eventually lost consciousness. I just took a few hits because I was bored and wanted to stay awake, she told Officer Robert. All I remember is that I started getting really hungry, ate some chicken wings and passed out recalls the police officer, visibly traumatized by the latest events. The 3-month-old child was found in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce, and was rushed to Springfields Mercy Hospital where doctors do not fear for his life. Apparently, the baby sitter tried to cook the baby in the microwave oven but she was unable to do so, and was probably disoriented and lost consciousness moments later, explained Sheriff Deputy Anderson James of the Jefferson County Police Department. Teeth marks were found on the babys arms and legs but luckily he is unharmed he acknowledged, visibly distraught by the whole affair. The state of Missouri has led, for more than a decade, the nation in methamphetamine busts. A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "label": "fake", "id": 373}

{"message": "The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues. This muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding: Anabolic Drugs Or Steroids Anabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain. These hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein. Beta-2 Agonists These synthetic drugs help expand the lungs capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Human Growth Hormone Also referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH. Ephedrine Bodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles. Methenolone Methenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it.", "title": "Historical blog about Seattle, as well as the state of affairs today.

Langone, a longtime Republican supporter and the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, said the Trump presidency offers the GOP, which also controls the House and the Senate, a unique time to deliver on the reasons Americans voted for a political outsider for the White House. Voters are fed up, Langone said on Squawk Box. They did a very dramatic, earth-shattering thing, and now want results, he said. Langone warned the Republicans that they could lose their majorities in the House and the Senate if lawmakers fail to seize this Trump-created opportunity. We own the next 25 years as a nation [if we act]. If you guys dont get your guys into a room and say Guys this is our moment. The American people will throw you out too, the next time, he warned House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy who also appeared as a guest Monday on Squawk Box. [Trump] has the capacity to go down as one of our greatest presidents ever if hes able to bring about big changes in health care, tax cuts and $1 trillion of infrastructure upgrades, Langone said. The American people elected him president, in my mind, for one reason: they dont want incremental change. They want major change, said Langone, founder and CEO of investment bank Invemed Associates, specializing in health-care and high-technology companies The Home Depot co-founder also came out in favor of the House GOPs border adjustment tax provision to help pay for their overall effort to cut corporate taxes.

{"message": "President Donald Trump has sent a strong message to the Russia Federation over the countrys ban on the peaceful activities of Jehovahs Witnesses. Trump warns Russia to reverse its decision immediately else he would use the countrys own constitution against them. You know right that this is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russia Federation. I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you  Trump warned. Trump went on to invite all Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia to seek asylum in the United States until their religious rights are reinstated in Russia. As this is an infringement of your fundamental human rights, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated.  Trump urged. Russias Supreme Court ruled on April 20, 2017 that the Jehovahs Witnesses organization should be closed down and no longer allowed to operate legally in Russia, Human Rights Watch said today. The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovahs Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russias obligations to respect and protect religious freedom. The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010. The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the groups administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations. Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case. The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russias ministry of justice and deem the Administrative Centre of Jehovahs Witnesses in Russia organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia, said judge Yuri Ivanenko. The property of the Jehovahs Witnesses organization is to be confiscated to the state revenue. A lawyer for the justice ministry, Svetlana Borisova, told the court adherents pose a threat to the rights of the citizens, public order and public security. Jehovahs Witnesses, who are known for door-to-door preaching and handing out literature, reject some of mainstream Christianitys core beliefs and have more than 8.3 million members around the world", "title": "Trump warns Russia over Jehovahs Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the US", "label": "fake", "id": 380}

The word Our in March For Our Lives refers to students. From Wikipedia: March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation. Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting using the hashtag #NeverAgain. The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky. Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place. European political researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D. C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. Dammegard received this email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department: Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event.

Although this may not be true, those who have looked into it know that strange anomalies have surrounded the Moon for decades. Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance, a quote attributed to Einstein holds true here. If you actually do some independent research, you might be quite shocked with what you find, especially when it comes to the credibility of the sources. As far back as 1970, two well-respected members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, created a hypothesis suggesting that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings. Fast forward to today, and we have former high-ranking members of the military and intelligence agencies sharing their knowledge with regards to strange things that are happening on the Moon. A few examples are listed in the articles linked below. Take for example Timothy Good, one of the worlds leading UFO researchers, who has lectured at universities, schools, and many organizations, including the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences, the Royal Canadian Military Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Naval Air Reserve Branch, the House of Lords All-Party UFO Study Group, and the Oxford and Cambridge Union societies. Good says that a former member of MI6 revealed her conversation with Neil Armstrong at a NASA conference, when he confirmed there were other spacecraft on the Moon when Apollo 11 landed in 1969. Armstrong also confirmed the CIA was behind the coverup. He also goes into more detail about it in this 2013 lecture. Dr. John Brandenburg, the Deputy Manager of the Clementine Mission to the Moon, which was part of a joint space project between the Ballistic Missile Defence Organization (BMDO) and NASA, has also made some fascinating revelations. The mission discovered water at the Moons poles in 1994 (Source: page 16 of 18)(source)(source).

{"message": "Year 2017 does not seem to be going well for the United States of America. Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country. On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook  an American corporation  being banned in the country. Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. \"Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,\" said Trump. Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site. Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order. The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion. Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's \"commitment\" should have not just been limited to Facebook. \"You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,\" Rowlinson said. \"You wouldn't get this from any other guy,\" he added, shaking his head. In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move. Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order. Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump. Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US. On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news. Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'. Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries. Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed. Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory. Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, In loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazioutlanle; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlems finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss yall. Related: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Richs Murder Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Rich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it. Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, Those who have suggested that Seths role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Rich appears elsewhere in Braziles book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Richs murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post. Brazile talked about Rich on ABC Newss This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: They dont know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They dont know what its like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich. Brazile had spoken publicly about Richs death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seths legacy to his country and party is shameful. About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, Seth was a good soul and look at this shameful act. Through spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, Since Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the familys efforts to find Seths killers. In the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clintons campaign headquarters seemed antiseptic, like a hospital, and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a slave. In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee. Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Braziles claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, It is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidates health. Brazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member.

{"message": "California Governor Jerry Brown just signed a draconian new law that makes it illegal to take a shower, and do laundry on the same day: Assembly Bill 1668 establishes a limit of 55 gallons per person daily as the standard for indoor residential water use, starting in the year 2022. Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years, the law states. According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether. Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit. According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030. To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas. So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features, the law states.  The new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses. This new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers. Even worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions. If the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.

These allegations have come up through recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese moon rover that allegedly found no traces of the American moon landings existing on the moon. World renowned Russian nuclear engineer Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin has also signed the petition as well as a dozen other top Russian engineers and ex-KGB agents claiming the Russian Government had always been aware of the situation since the early 1970s These recent discoveries could strangely give credence to conspiracy theorists whom have claimed for decades that America had never gone to the moon but that the American moon landings were but an elaborate hoax to foul Russia into the space race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining Russia, much like the financing of the Mujahideen forces during the soviet Afghanistan war successfully achieved.", "title": "WorldNewsDailyReport.com- Chinese Lunar Rover Finds No Evidence Of American Moon Landings", "label": "fake", "id": 403}

Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section. He did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but its hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the students rights.

{"message": "Snopes Paid to Push Propaganda by Facebook, Former Editor Reveals Claims 'fact-checkers' are paid to 'appear to prevent damage' while pushing an agenda  press Former managing editor at Snopes Brooke Binkowski says the 'fact-checker' is pushing 'propaganda' Snopes is paid by Facebook to push \"propaganda,\" according to the former managing editor of the \"fact-checker,\" who claims the social media giant \"doesn't care\" about facts and is using journalists to promote an agenda so it can \"pass the buck.\" According to a bombshell report by the Guardian, several current and former Facebook fact-checkers have stepped forward and spoken out to reveal their distrust in the social network and their fact-checking employers. Facebook has fact-checking partnerships with Snopes, PolitiFact, Factcheck.org, the Weekly Standard, and Associated Press, and uses the information provided by these organizations to reduce the reach of posts that are \"debunked\" in their News Feed. The partnering with these fact-checkers has come under heavy criticism, mainly due to the almost-monopolized influence news on Facebook has, which is then being filtered out by unregulated individuals who are often financially motivated and express political bias. Theyve essentially used us for crisis PR, declared former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski during an interview with the Guardian. Theyre not taking anything seriously. \"They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buck \"They clearly dont care. Youre not doing journalism anymore. Youre doing propaganda, she continued, adding, They threw us under the bus at every opportunity. Another former Snopes employee, Kim LaCapria, recently left the company over its partnership with Facebook, accusing it of focusing only on the appearance of trying to prevent damage without actually doing anything, and expressing distaste with the fact that Snopes was being paid by Facebook. LaCapria said she was particularly upset to learn that Facebook was paying Snopes: That felt really gross  Facebook has one mission and fact-checking websites should have a completely different mission. Aside from allegedly being paid by Facebook, Snopes also generates revenue by filling its website with advertisements from Google Adsense, asking for donations from readers via PayPal, and has an active GoFundMe campaign to \"Save Snopes\" which has so far generated over $850,000 of its $2 million goal. Of course, it's understandable that a website has overheads that need to be covered, but when a company is primarily driven by profit, how can they be trusted to remain non-partisan? According to a report by the Daily Mail, Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused of embezzling thousands from the company. Mikkelson's ex-wife Barbara, claimed in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on \"himself and prostitutes.\" During the lengthy and bitter legal dispute, CEO David Mikkelson also claimed to be underpaid and was demanding the \"industry standard\" or at least $360,000 a year. Being motivated by \"facts\" is apparently very lucrative. And in the case of Snopes, their business model is a simple, yet devastatingly effective one since they partnered with Facebook and Google: They debunk viral news, and posts. Therefore, if a post goes viral on social media, and Snopes says that it's \"false,\" then it will be flagged as so and Facebook will place a link to the \"fact-check,\" thus driving more traffic and revenue to Snopes. Due to this arrangement, it adds a clear incentive to mark a viral news story as false rather than confirming lesser-known facts as true.  press Snopes founder David Mikkelson was accused on embezzling company money Over recent months this push to flag big news stories as \"false,\" mainly from conservative websites, has become more apparent. In November, Breitbart accused Snopes of attempting to \"wash away\" the story of armed members of the New Black Panther Party campaigning for the Democrat gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, Stacey Abrams. According to Breitbart, the move was an \"openly partisan\" attempt to protect Abrams after the damaging story went viral. Earlier this month, The Daily Caller also accused Snopes of left-bias after it \"botched\" its fact-check of a viral meme that was mocked within political circles for spreading false information. Snopes said that the general idea of the meme was correct, yet, according to the TheDCNF, the fact-checker intentionally framed it that way as it portrayed President Trump in a negative light if the \"wildly misleading\" meme was true. In Snopes \"transparency\" disclaimer, it states that it operates \"without any partisan considerations,\" saying: \"We dont choose or exclude items for coverage based on whether they deal with Republican/Democratic, conservative/liberal, or religious/secular issues.\" Despite this statement, the left-leaning bias of their fact-checkers is clear. Snopes' \"science dude\" Alex Kasprak makes no secret of his political bias, and one look at his Twitter account shows it is filled with anti-Trump rhetoric and retweets of Trump-bashing posts. The only way to report on that \"totally clears the president\" tweet is to highlight it as an example of our president's abject delusion, not as a valid legal opinion or as \"breaking news\"  Alex H. Kasprak (@alexkasprak) December 8, 2018 Prior to joining Snopes, Kasprak wrote for left-wing news outlets Motherboard and BuzzFeed and is pegged as a \"science writer\" who mainly \"debunks\" science-related articles. It comes as no surprise then that Kasprak mainly fact-checks conservative news sites, often using derogatory language when describing the outlets and their writers, using terms such as \"right-wing blog\" and \"junk news.\" Biting the hand that feeds Snopes apparent bias has seen the company suffer considerably over recent months as it continues to abuse its influence over Facebook's News Feed to promote a political agenda. Visits to snopes.com have plummeted by almost half over recent months as users are seemingly losing trust in the organization. According to website data tool SimilarWeb, visits to Snopes dropped another 20 percent in November to 19.59 million for the month. This number is a considerable drop from their July figure of 37.79 million, representing a staggering 48.16 percent drop in website traffic in just four months. While it's unclear what has caused this drop, when you consider that being flagged as \"fake news\" on Facebook cuts reach to the websites being debunked, it's clear to see that attacking the sources of their viral \"fact-checks,\" is hardly sustainable if it destroys the sites that it continually attacks.  SimilarWeb Website visits to Snopes have plummeted by almost 50 percent since July The appearance of trying to prevent damage Why should we trust Facebook when its pushing the same rumors that its own fact checkers are calling fake news? an unnamed Facebook fact-checker told the Guardian. Its worth asking how do they treat stories about George Soros on the platform knowing they specifically pay people to try to link political enemies to him?[] Working with Facebook makes us look bad. According to Breitbart, one fact-checker who has reportedly long worked with Facebook even referred to the social network as a terrible company, declaring, and, on a personal level, I dont want to have anything to do with them, while another fact-checker proclaimed, Most of us feel its more trouble than its worth. Facebook started its fact-checking efforts following President Trumps 2016 presidential election victory and is even expanding into fact-checking images and videos. Left-wing biases have been found at nearly all Facebook fact-check partners in the United States, including Snopes, Politifact, and the Weekly Standard. An investigation revealed that Snopes employs left-wing people almost exclusively, with some of its most prominent fact-checkers openly describing themselves as progressive and expressing anti-Trump sentiment. A satirical article from popular satire website Babylon Bee about CNN using a washing machine to spin the news, was also nearly removed by Facebook after Snopes fact-checked it as false. One of Facebooks other top fact-checking partners, Politifact, is funded by a frequent Clinton Foundation donor, and gave preferential treatment to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election  rating 51 percent of Clintons claims as true versus just over 15 percent for Trump. Even a 2013 article from one of Facebooks other fact-checking partners, the Weekly Standard, claimed Politifact has it out for Republicans, and the Weekly Standard itself has also pushed out misleading information during its partnership with Facebook. UPDATE: Since this article was published, and subsequently went viral on social media, Snopes CEO David Mikkelson denied the information we presented in this article. Snopes didn't \"fact-check\" or \"debunk\" any of the information, nor did they present any evidence to refute the claims. Mikkelson, however, saw fit to abuse his position as Facebook approved \"fact-checker\" and flagged our story as a \"hoax\" with Facebook, pulling it from users' News Feed, immediately squashing the story as a result.

{"message": "President Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the presidents heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018 Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the harm he claims. The Be careful what you wish for Max! quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps the Second Amendment people i.e., gun owners could solve the problem. While some people may consider Trumps tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the presidents hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates. Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump. According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Lloyds plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that: If you continue to make threats towards the president, youre going to wind up dead, Maxine, cause well kill you. The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a spur of the moment decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat. Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trumps penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition. The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence. When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trumps feet. Correction: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trumps tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trumps June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors. President Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyds plea. Therefore the conclusion that Trumps bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid.", "title": "Correction: A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radio", "label": "fake", "id": 411}

Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and Londons Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism. In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. We do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday. Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports: The new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state. It means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism. Millions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we dont take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law. The Guardian compares the law to Hitler: There is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists  and even moderate Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler. Yes, thats rightbecause apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow intolerant. Well do you know what most Americans think? Youre damn right its intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500s AD? We shouldnt! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam. Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is unfair, and discriminates, against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted. Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there6th safest in the world, to be exact. Although Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world. After the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all. With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving.", "title": "BREAKING: CZECH REPUBLIC ARMS CITIZENS  YOU CAN NOW SHOOT TERRORISTS ON SIGHT", "label": "fake", "id": 422}

One of Twitter's senior engineers has admitted to hacking the president's private data and leaking it to the Department of Justice to \"help with their little investigation.\" The high-level engineer, Clay Haynes, a self-confessed \"bleeding-heart liberal,\" boasted to covert investigators that his team can access all activity of every user on the site, and can even retrieve deleted messages. After confessing that the social media sites extreme monitoring of its users was \"big brother-ish,\" he admitted that Twitter disclosed all of Donald Trump's messages to the DOJ, saying: \"Even the ones hes deleted, any direct messages\"  Youtube The investigation into Twitter was conducted by Project Veritas A Project Veritas undercover investigation has revealed a senior network security engineer at Twitter stating that his company is more than happy to turn over the private communications and deleted tweets of President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice. If true, it is yet unknown whether Twitter is voluntarily disclosing this sensitive information or acting under a court order.  Youtube Senior engineer Clay Haynes admitted to leaking he president's private messages Twitter is currently in the midst of defending itself from left-leaning criticism that President Trump hasnt been removed from the enormous media platform for violations of Twitters Terms of Service. According to his LinkedIn profile, Clay Haynes has been employed by Twitter since September 2016. On January 3, 2018, he met with a Project Veritas undercover journalist (UCJ) at Stookey's Club Moderne in San Francisco.  Youtube James OKeefe went undercover to expose Twitter Using a hidden video camera, the Veritas UCJ captures Haynes stating that were more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation of President Trump. When prompted by the UCJ, Mr. Haynes provides additional details, Basically, giving them every single tweet that hes posted. Even the ones hes deleted, any direct messages, any mentions  Youtube Clay Haynes boasts that Twitter can access anyone's private data hes dangerous, I dont like him and hes a terrible human being and I want to get rid of him, the self-described bleeding-heart liberal Haynes says in the video about President Trump. In fact, we had internal reviews about that On January 7, 2018, James OKeefe himself went undercover with Haynes at Mortons Steakhouse in San Francisco to confirm if Twitter was working with the Department of Justice to hand over Trumps tweets and DMs.  Youtube Twitter's senior engineer boasting about leaking Donald Trump's data When pressed about looking at Donald Trumps messages, Haynes explained: We have a subpoena process for that very reason. The conversation continued: James OKeefe: Are you working with DOJ currently on that? Clay Haynes: I cant comment, even if I knew, I wouldnt comment.  Youtube Twitter has access to all user's private data according to Haynes The fact is, even if Haynes was just speculating about helping Justice, his admission shows a clear and dangerous political bias at the highest levels of Twitter, says Project Veritas founder and President James OKeefe in the video. The question is: by Twitter giving private information about the President to the Justice Department, are they breaking the law, betraying a trust, following an official request or satisfying a political agenda by leading a crusade against the President.  PV Project Veritas exposed political bias at the highest levels of Twitter Describing himself as the bouncer of the network, Mr. Haynes also details the level of information Twitter retains in its databases about their hundreds of millions of users. The Project Veritas Twitter investigation is the fourth installment of its American Pravda series. In Part I, Veritas disclosed that CNN's Russia coverage is driven by ratings and a political agenda, but in reality, using the words of CNN Political Commentator Van Jones is just a nothing burger.  Youtube Clay Haynes is a self-confessed 'bleeding-heart liberal' Part II disclosed a political bias at The New York Times which forced executive responses and an immediate change of their social media policy. Part III exposed political bias at The Washington Post and brought to light that the far-reaching narratives of the papers editorial board are not rooted in the factual findings of their subject-matter expert reporters.

{"message": "Ravi Bhalla was elected Hobokens 39th Mayor on November 7, 2017 out of a field of six candidates. Born and raised in New Jersey, Mayor Bhalla is a 17 year resident of Hoboken and eight year member of the Hoboken City Council. He received his undergraduate education from the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a B.A. in Political Psychology. Upon graduation, he attended the London School of Economics (L.S.E.) in the United Kingdom and received a Master of Science degree in Public Administration and Public Policy, and also earned a Juris Doctor Degree from Tulane Law School in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ravi first set his roots in Hoboken at the age of 26, a bachelor fresh out of law school starting his first job at a small law firm in Newark, New Jersey. Ravi earned national recognition in the New York Times for his legal advocacy after suffering a violation of his own constitutional and civil rights during a jail visit to a client. The incident motivated Ravi to lead a successful campaign to reform the federal governments visitation policies at correctional facilities nationwide. Ravi married his wife Bindya, and they had two children, Arza and Shahbegh. It was during this time that Hobokens local government was in dire straits. He observed and witnessed mismanaged government at the local level, including a government budget that was underfunded and overspent by $12 million, a state takeover of Hoboken, and a 70% spike in municipal taxes in a single year. Ravi ran for Council alongside Mayor Zimmer and worked tirelessly to get their message out of restoring honesty, professionalism and fiscal responsibility to Hoboken. Out of twelve candidates vying for 3 council-at-large positions, Ravi received the highest number of votes, as a first time candidate for office. Once in office, Ravi worked hard alongside Mayor Zimmer and his council colleagues to establish tangible reforms to the way government is run in Hoboken. Municipal taxes were reduced and Hobokens finances were put on a responsible long-term path. The Citys bond rating was improved from junk bond status in 2009 to AA+ in 2013, the second highest rating, and had a responsible cash surplus for the first time in years. Ravi was a leading voice on the council for securing the necessary funding for Hobokens second flood pump in Northwest Hoboken, advocated with Mayor Zimmer for the addition of 9 acres of open space, ensured our parks were built with detention systems to help alleviate flooding, voted to add progressive transportation options including corner cars and bike share, and played a large role in saving the hospital from closing in 2013, preserving more than 1,200 jobs and relieving taxpayers of a $52 million bond guarantee. Ravi currently sits as a co-chair of the Citys Rebuild by Design project, in which the City was awarded $230 million to comprehensively protect Hoboken from storm surge events like Superstorm Sandy. Ravi served as Council President from 2011-2012 and Council Vice-President from 2010-2011  and  2013-2014 and was Chairman of the Hoboken Democratic Party from 2010-2011. Prior to his service as a Councilman, Mr. Bhalla served as a local Democratic Committeeman for the 2nd Ward, 3rd District of Hoboken from 2007-2009.

The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior  which she said had shaken (her) to the core. First and foremost, Pence argued, I have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. Thats the first thing I dont quite get. Secondly, if shes the First Lady, shouldnt she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? Whats she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? Thats not what she should be doing. The governor of Indiana also said that she has no business commenting on men and their restroom talk, as well as that thats not ladylike behavior. Now, I know that the word lady is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me shes not behaving like one, at least as of late, he said. If she was a real lady, she wouldnt be commenting on mens restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason. He continued, If we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadnt heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar shes not only being vocal about it, but shes also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who cant see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She cant fool me, just like she cant fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself. How many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk? Pence asked. He has apologized for it several times, and I really dont know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasnt enough, the first lady also thinks shes ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. Thats just ridiculous. There is no way in hell Michelle Obama isnt working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama.

{"message": "Bill Gates has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that by making people healthier, we can reduce the worlds population. Make no mistake, when Gates talks about making people healthier, what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory roll out of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents. The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them. Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests. The irony of Bill Gates faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny. Last year, Indias National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting to make people healthier were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls  and that the Gates Foundation campaigns were actually experimental trials of the vaccines. Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women. The philanthropist has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who have no benefit whatsoever to society. This cold, skewed psychopathic logic is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th centurys most evil regimes. Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates depopulation agenda playing out around the world. Kenya doesnt find his Gates fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates back pocket: Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination, Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared. Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations. Lets ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives? None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.

{"message": "UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents. The U.S. Immigration  and  Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires. Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him, according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed. Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer. Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration  and  Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a sanctuary county in May 2014. The county only cooperates with ICE holds if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalezs immigration status has not yet been announced. The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures under the U.S. Constitutions Fourth Amendment. The Sonoma County Sheriff Departments 1.0 Policy Statement reads: No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status. The policy adds that the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriffs Office personnel execute their duties. According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers. Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated  about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.", "title": "ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail", "label": "fake", "id": 432}

{"message": "Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called heartbeat bill, a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant womans life or preventing the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. At the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions, Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. Women are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, Im sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them. He continued, Our mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And theres one very simple reason why I did it. Thats that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when theyre supposed to be closed, if she doesnt have the foresight to make sure she doesnt get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion. A woman like that can barely take care of herself, and were supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child  a being whos done no wrong and only exists as its mothers mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter? Kasich said. I dont know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening. And Ill tell you another thing  as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isnt married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place.

This has always been a thorn in the side of Marines and naturally a source of ridicule from other branches. In 1834 Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service. The Marines will improve their amphibious attack readiness, and will continue to use the Navy for transportation to be the First to Fight. The Marines will have an entirely new ROE and mission. Marine units that dont accomplish the mission within the 2 month window will be reassigned by the Marine Corps, and will have to watch as another unit finishes the job. The Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that cant get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia.

Kushner, who is President Trumps son-in-law, will no longer be able to access top-secret intelligence, Politico confirmed, noting three sources close to the situation. Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level. According to Politico, the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly. White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trumps job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN. Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president. Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is playing government, while branding her child tax credit as a pet project. The shocking report comes after Trumps trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly. This isnt like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex, a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.

{"message": "Emma Gonzlez is a survivor of the Parkland shooting and a leader of the movement against gun violence. She has also become a target in far-right circles. (Video: Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post, Photo: Andrew Harnik/The Washington Post) Share Having teenagers act as figureheads for a movement has a certain quality that has not gone unnoticed in the wake of the March for Our Lives rally on Saturday. Judge too harshly, and you are attacking a kid who has balanced trauma with homework. Amplifying students such as Emma Gonzlez has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society. Gonzlez, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentines Day. Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior and survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting delivered the final speech at Washington's March for Our Lives on March 24. (Video: The Washington Post) Gun-control advocates have held up Gonzlez as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images. Advertisement Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism. A doctored animation of Gonzlez tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, Gonzlez is ripping apart a gun-range target. The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States. The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin. He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading #Vorwrts!  the German word for forward and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word. Advertisement Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was satire. It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users. The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider. Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right), referencing a user named Linda NRA Supporter who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended. Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur  Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018 Moynihans tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table. Advertisement Generally, one form of criticism of Gonzlez and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages. Share this article Share They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the rights criticism of Hoggs insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights. The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first top news video that appears in a YouTube search for David Hogg is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. Its hard to not just go after this kid, host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg. Other elements of Gonzlez have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off. For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket. Advertisement Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry, one meme shared on Reddits conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. Gonzlezs father migrated from Cuba to the United States. As The Posts Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet dont speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense, said a post on Kings campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of Gonzlez at the podium Saturday. Advertisement A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics  a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate. The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now its represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. Boycott this, boycott that. Its detracting from the actual discussions, Kashuv told The Posts Dan Zak about the work of his classmates. Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward. Advertisement But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit. Hoggs comments at the rally were egregious and inflammatory, Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hoggs use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer. Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student. You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes? Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter. Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.

After a long list of failed attempts to bring on high-profile attorneys, Trump ultimately settled on former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. However, things havent gone quite as expected since the inception of Giuliani. Hes caused the president more harm than good, notably when he contradicted the presidents story regarding the hush payment sent to Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. Now, it appears that instead of getting kicked off the team by Trump, the president is desperate enough to need Rudy in a full-time role. On April 19th, Rudy officially went on leave from the law firm Greenberg Traurig. Today, the executive chairman of the firm, Richard Rosenbaum, announced that Rudy has formally resigned from the firm. Rosenbaum said in a statement: When Rudy Giuliani took an unpaid leave of absence from the firm, his intent was to play a limited role, for a short period of time, to address specific matters for President Trump. After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign from the firm, effective May 9th.

{"message": "January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynns life. She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisas wedding, along with her younger sister Grace. Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony. The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles  but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katies life. After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the brides parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifers husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home. I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where youre seeing people for the last time, the groom, David, told CNN. The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Mar in Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident. Police reports revealed that Heidgens blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred. The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The brides father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage. Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash. Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness  her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt. One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the brides uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before: I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, Dont go back there. Its bad, Michael Tangney said. I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family. But, tragically, the worst was yet to come. Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughters head in her hands. Katies body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous. For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katies head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle. Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughters face one last time. The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder  though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifers daughter. Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again. Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story, Jennifer said. I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future. The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you. Im sure youve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies. Some people, unfortunately, have even had to experience it first-hand, just like Jennifer and her family. Please share this story to remind any and all that alcohol and driving are a combination that never belong together.

{"message": "(WKRG)  UPDATE 3:31 p.m.  The Executive Editor, Marty Baron, of the Washington Post released the following statement: The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post. The calls description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism. Another development involving the U.S. Senate race in Alabama. At least one person in our viewing area received a robocall seeking more damaging information about Roy Moore. Here is the text of that voicemail message received by Pastor Al Moore in Creola. Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, Im a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5000 and $7000 dollars. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report. I can be reached by email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com, thank you. Pastor Moore says hes baffled about who might be behind the message. He said he sent a response to the email address provided but it came back undeliverable. We also tried the email address with the same result. John Rogers with the Roy Moore campaign says its the first hes heard of this type of robocall. We contacted the Washington Post but it would be highly unlikely that a newspaper would offer thousands of dollars for information, damaging or otherwise. We searched and could not find a record of a Bernie or Al Bernstein who works as a reporter at the Washington Post. If any of you have received the same call, please let us know at producers@wkrg.com", "title": "Curious Robocall Seeks Damaging Information on Moore", "label": "fake", "id": 456}
{"message": "President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (its hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote. A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The resolution wasnt sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a discriminatory manner, particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia. While some are saying that a no vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations. To have a no vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this. Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said: It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love. This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end. Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including: Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity. Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order. Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly. Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.", "title": "Trump Votes For Death Penalty For Being Gay", "label": "fake", "id": 457}

He attached a picture of himself laying on a couch in a room that just happened to have seven yellow Tour de France jerseys on the wall. Purely random, I'm sure. It's not a #humblebrag as much as it's a #shoveitinyourfacebrag. It's cocky, it's condescending and it's not going to help Armstrong's battered public image. Contrition, not defiance, is the way to go. Armstrong was banned for life last month by the International Cycling Union and stripped of those seven Tour wins. (The jerseys, apparently, can stay.) Look, I'm on Lance Armstrong's side, as much as one can be on the side of a suspected/known cheater. His cycling wins may have been a sham (just like victories by most athletes in the sport) but his work for cancer research, awareness and patients has been inspirational. Would it have been better if Armstrong stayed clean, became a middling cyclist and Livestrong never existed? I don't see how any logical person could make that argument. Shades of gray cloud the picture, of course, but I still think his net contribution to our world is greater than his flaws. Regardless, Armstrong stepped down Monday from the Livestrong board. He founded the charity in 1997. If pictures like this are any indication, Armstrong has moved past denial into the anger phase of his coping. Next he'll be trying to buy Tour titles off Miguel Indurain, followed by his growing a beard phase and then he'll accept his actions, sit down for an interview with Oprah and get back into the good graces of the American public.

After nearly half a decade working on Late Night With Seth Meyers and The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, Wolf is set to host her own weekly show on Netflix. The streaming giant, which is making a considerable push in the talk-show space with entries from David Letterman and Joel McHale, is billing Wolfs show as a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy. The planned star vehicle will launch later this year. The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda  unless, of course, its funny. You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldnt do on TV, Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflixs vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: Were thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice. The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (I want equal pay! And a chardonnay) to dating and other social issues. Though Wolf is still a relative fresh face on the stand-up circuit, she has already earned the respect of several comedic heavyweights, or former heavyweights, including Louis C.K., who tapped her to open for him on his 2016 stand-up tour and to act in his celebrated web show Horace and Pete, and Chris Rock, who hired her to write for his Oscars ceremony. By jumping to Netflix, Wolf marks the latest star to exit Comedy Central  and in her case, as it was for predecessors like John Oliver, just as her career is taking off. In addition to her contributor duties on the cable networks Daily Show, Wolf created and starred in two digital series, Now Hiring and Used People, for the Viacom network. Looking ahead, Wolfs Netflix show, a rare and much-welcomed female-fronted series in what is still a male-dominated space, will be produced via her Cats in Pants banner. Dan Powell (Inside Amy Schumer) and Christine Nangle (The Presidents Show, The Mick) will serve as co-showrunners, with her manager Daniel Bodansky joining them as an executive producer.

Bowe Bergdahl, the Army sergeant facing charges of desertion, walked out of a military courtroom during a pre-trial hearing Monday and has not been seen since approximately 10:35 AM, prompting a statewide manhunt for the missing soldier. Sources inside the courtroom say that Bergdahl took only a half-full Camelbak and a long hunting knife with him as he calmly made his way to the exit during his own lawyers remarks to the judge regarding a possible plea deal. Bergdahl left behind a note stating that he intended to start a new life, that he did not believe in the legal proceedings taking place around him, and that he did not want to fight for his defense anymore. Life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, Bergdahl wrote, adding, I am ashamed to even be an American [deserter]. Three soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division were reportedly injured during the search for Bergdahl. Staff Sgt. Randy Parker was admitted to Womack Army Medical Center for a broken collarbone he received when his military police vehicle hit a roadside traffic safety device, causing it to roll over. Two unnamed Army privates were injured in an unrelated incident involving a floor buffer and rubber training rifles, which they insisted were necessary to the search effort.

But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets.

{"message": "Home Leading The News Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have Leading The News Have you been to Iraq?  76 sens. say they have By Patrick Fitzgerald At least 76 senators have visited Iraq in the four years of combat, including 38 who have made the trip in the last 12 months, according to a survey by The Hill. But at least 18 senators have not traveled there at all. As debate over the war reaches a tipping point in Washington, visiting Iraq has become a rite of passage for many lawmakers looking to bolster their credibility on national security. Many lawmakers feel that making a trip is important for their credibility when they are asked to weigh in on the war. Have you been to Iraq? Graham charged. Have you ever been and talked to them? Webb, who has not made a trip to the country, replied by disparaging the congressional delegations as dog and pony shows that do not confront the reality on the ground. Webbs views may well be the exception, as many senators still make the visit. Topping the list is Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has visited Iraq 10 times. That includes three trips in the past year and makes him one of nine senators who have made at least a half-dozen trips to the country since the war started. On the other side of the aisle, neither George Voinovich (Ohio) nor Pete Domenici (N.M.)  two Senate Republicans who recently made headlines by breaking with the Bush administration and calling for a new direction in Iraq  has visited the country. But similarly critical Republicans John Warner (Va.), Olympia Snowe (Maine) and Gordon Smith (Ore.) have all made the trip more than once. James Thurber, professor of political science and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said that Iraq visits give lawmakers more credibility on the war. The more trips you go give you more authority, Thurber said. But seeing the situation and speaking with the troops on the ground can reinforce pre-existing notions about the war, Thurber said. He added that some senators have already made up their minds about whats going on before making a trip. Indeed, many of the more outspoken lawmakers on both sides of the Iraq debate are among the most traveled, and few have changed their minds after returning. Besides Reed, war critics such as Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Joseph Biden (D-Del.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.) have all made multiple trips. Levin tops that group with eight visits. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), an ardent defender of the war effort, has gone to Iraq eight times, while Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) have each made six trips. Senators of both parties have made visiting Iraq a priority. Of the 11 senators who have made more than four trips, seven are Republicans, three are Democrats and one, Lieberman, is an Independent who caucuses with Democrats. The common thread linking senators with the highest trip totals appears to be membership on either the Senate Armed Services Committee or the Foreign Relations Committee. The dozen lawmakers who have made more than three trips are all on one of these two prominent panels. At least 38 senators have visited Iraq in the past 12 months, led by Reed, Graham and McCain, who have each visited the country three times in that span. Among the 2008 presidential candidates, the numerous trips by Biden (seven) and McCain (six) lead the field, largely due to their leadership positions on relevant committees. Biden is chairman of Foreign Relations, while McCain is ranking member on Armed Services. Among the other contenders, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) each boast three trips to Iraq. Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) has made the trip twice, while Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has visited Iraq once.

Think of it this way: Im someone you would trust to run your household and to keep it safe while you went away on a trip or a vacation. I could even fix a few things around the house. After all, the construction company I founded began as a one-man handy-man operation. Can you say the same for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? Ive balanced budgets and cut taxes.

In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana. Senator Bernie Sanders came to that viewpoint  a position that most Americans support  16 years later. Im also a strong believer in our Constitutional rights to civil liberties and privacy. Our government should not be spying on the electronic communications of American citizens. Nor should our iPhones or Android devices be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures. And I understand that, as a nation and as a society, we have unfinished business to right the wrongs of injustice suffered by minorities. Blacks are 30 percent more likely that white to be apprehended by the police; they are three times more likely to be searched; they are arrested twice as often as whites; and they are 75 percent more likely to be charged with offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences. It is not surprising that there is tangible mistrust, tension and frustration between the police and African-Americans, particularly black males. We need to speak honestly about these issues in order to address them. Lets be honest. We have healing to do. One of the biggest concerns that many voters have with both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, but particularly with Ms. Clinton, is the sense that she uses government power to advance her personal and political interests. She is the very status quo. Americans want that changed. She talks about progressivism, but lines her bank accounts with speaking fees from banks and special interests. Thats what crony capitalism is all about. Americans recognize pay-to-play when they see it, and they are really, really weary of it. Having been governor of New Mexico, I know that legislation gets passed to benefit those who have money and influence. Then they buy more money and influence. Thats one reason why, as governor, I vetoed more than 750 bills and thousands of line items. I did it to keep crony capitalism away from government. Another big difference between Hillary Clinton and myself is that Im for our national tradition of peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations  while being extremely skeptical of committing ourselves and our armed forces to foreign conflicts. As a Senator, she endorsed ill-advised foreign interventions. As Secretary of State, she was the architect of tragic and counter-productive policies in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. These should not be Americas wars, and we ought not be prompting regime changes that serve only to replace bad actors with even worse actors and instability that makes us less safe. Instead, our nation need the confidence that its president will be predictable, yes, but also skeptical of engaging in international shenanigans all around the world. Americans can find sanity and principle by voting Johnson/Weld in 2016.", "title": "Theres another choice", "label": "real", "id": 474}
{"message": "Republican Senator Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes sit on opposite sides of the debate about the role of money in U.S. elections.A deluge of campaign cash is playing a significant role in Kentucky's Senate race thus far.The money raised by the campaigns and outside groups is expected to top the $100 million mark and go down as the most expensive in U.S. history.More than any lawmaker, McConnell is the face of looseningif not, eliminatingcampaign finance regulations.For over a decade the GOP leader has espoused that money and free speech are synonymous. He has filed legal briefs urging the Supreme Court to reaffirm its Citizens United decision and supports a controversial case to further deregulate contribution limits placed on individuals.In a March 17 e-mail to supporters, Grimes took a strong stance against the influence wealthy donors are having and calls out McConnell as the chief architect and beneficiary of that system.\"Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnells campaign,\" Grimes said. \"Hes the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle and his Karl Rove-affiliated Super PACs are clogging the Commonwealth's airwaves with negative attack ads. Enough is enoughour democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.\"Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage. But given the left's apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court's dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.\"It's very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,\" says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund. \"She understands that money in politics drowns out the voices of every day Kentuckians. This is a sharp difference between her and McConnell, someone who is advocating the make the problem worse.\"The Grimes campaign message also directs voters to sign a petition calling on Congress to \"stop special interest billionaires,\" that has the support of red state Democratic senators such as Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia.In the 2014 election cycle, there are almost 1,000 registered super PACs that have generated over $141 million and spent more than $24.8 million on races.According to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership is among the ranks among the top ten groups in this year's races.Democrats and liberal activists decrying the influence of money in politics have themselves pointed out its limitations in Kentucky's Senate race.McConnell has spent over half of the $20 million he's raised this cycle and he has a number of outside groups spending millions in advertisements supporting his re-election. Yet McConnell's approval ratings remain terribly low and Grimes either leads or ties the GOP leader in most polling.Former FEC Chairman Michael Toner says despite arguments that the wealthy are purchasing American elections, those independent expenditure committees haven't always worked out for candidates.\"One reason the federal courts over the years have not found a corruption threat at the independent spending is that sometimes it's not that effective in directly advancing a candidate's interest,\" he says.\"A lot of candidates who spend more money than their opponents whether out of their own pocket or let's say supported by major outside groups, their track record in winning elections is not that good to be honest. We've seen a lot of multi-millionaire candidates who are defeated in various races. Now to be sure some are also elected, but by now means is the candidate with the most money spent on their behalf assured of being elected.\"Grimes has raised $4.5 million since entering the race last year and been all over the country at fundraisers with big name Democratic donors. She outpaced McConnell's money machine during the third quarter and Democratic-affiliated groups have also spent money attacking McConnell in television ads.The McConnell campaign was quick to point out that while Grimes is criticizing Citizens United, she is also benefiting from attack ads against the senator from outside liberal groups who praise her position.\"Like Barack Obama, Alison Lundergan Grimes is obviously much more concerned with political convenience than Constitutional protections,\" McConnell campaign spokeswoman Allison Moore told WFPL. \"The sad part is that she apparently sees no irony in the fact the special interest group who successfully persuaded her to embrace trampling on our First Amendment rights in the name of money in politics is the same one running hundreds of thousands of dollars of advertising on her behalf.\"The top expenditures in 2014 have been super PACs with liberal viewpoints such as Senate Majority PAC, which has slammed McConnell in TV ads.Asked about Grimes' wealthy donors, Donnelly says all elected officials and candidates are implicated but that what lawmakers do in Washington matters.\"The real distinction is what are you going to do to clean it up and propose pro-actively to make the system better,\" he says. \"And on that score voters know in Alison Grimes they have someone who is going to champion the issue and that in Mitch McConnell who is going to make the problem worse.\"", "title": "Mitch McConnell, Alison Lundergan Grimes Have 'Sharp Differences' on Campaign Finance Rules", "label": "real", "id": 475}

And at the top of the news this week, the Gang of 20. At the big summit in Seoul, U.S. economic policies come under fire from China and Germany. Are America's woes putting its global leadership in question? OBAMA: A whole host of other countries are doing very well. Naturally, they are going to be more assertive. AMANPOUR: Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham debate America's role in the world. Then, American austerity. BOWLES: The path we're on today is not sustainable. We are headed for disaster. AMANPOUR: Two members of the president's deficit commission, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad and Honeywell International Chairman and CEO David Cote share some sobering views on tough economic choices the United States faces. And the coming showdown over tax cuts. BOEHNER: Making these permanent will be the most important thing we could do to help create jobs in the country. AMANPOUR: That and all the week's politics on our roundtable with George Will, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post, and Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution. And the Sunday funnies. FALLON: China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's biggest economy in the next two years. Americans couldn't believe it. They were like, \"That hasn't happened already?\" (LAUGHTER) ANNOUNCER: From all across our world to the heart of our nation's capital, ABC \"This Week\" with Christiane Amanpour starts now. (END VIDEO CLIP) AMANPOUR: And hello again. By the time Air Force One lands in Washington this evening, it will have flown around the world, a world that is fast changing, as the president found out during his 10-day trip to Asia. ABC's senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper has been with the president and brings us this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TAPPER (voice-over): Rebuked by American voters and reminded to focus more on the economy, President Obama began his Asian trip talking it up as a sort of international stimulus to open markets to American goods and bolster American jobs. OBAMA: We're actually doing some business while we're here. With every $1 billion we sell in exports, 5,000 jobs are supported at home. For America, this is a job strategy. TAPPER: In Mumbai, India, flanked by American CEOs, the president announced deals between U.S. and Indian companies totaling nearly $10 billion in U.S. exports and maintaining more than 50,000 American jobs. A cause for celebration, as he and the first lady joined in on the festivities marking the Hindu holiday of Diwali. (on-screen): By the end of the week here in South Korea, there was no cause for dancing. Some of the world's fastest-growing economies refused President Obama's entreaties to alter their economic policies, policies the president needs changed to fully implement his export strategy, his job strategy. OBAMA: Instead of hitting home runs, sometimes we're going to hit singles. TAPPER (voice-over): And sometimes he struck out, failing to convince South Korea to open their markets to American beef and cars. At stake: $10 billion in exports and 70,000 American jobs. Failing to convince Chinese President Hu Jintao to stop artificially building up the dollar and holding down Chinese currency. And failing to convince his fellow G-20 leaders to use stronger language in the joint declaration on China's currency manipulation. OBAMA: That is an irritant not just to the United States, but is an irritant to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world. TAPPER: The president was even forced to push back on attacks that the U.S. was engaging in its own currency manipulation, defending a move by the independent Federal Reserve to inject $600 billion into the U.S. economy. OBAMA: From everything I can see, this decision was not one designed to have an impact on the currency, on the dollar. It was designed to grow the economy. TAPPER: Criticisms from G-20 leaders who questioned President Obama's spending habits were made all the more relevant when the co-chairs of the president's own debt commission put forth controversial proposals to reduce the deficit. BOWLES: This debt is like a cancer that will truly destroy this country from within. TAPPER: Ones attacked by liberals and conservative, showing how difficult reducing the deficit will be.

So much so that I felt compelled to bring back our segment where we hold politicians, leaders, and pundits accountable for what comes out of their mouths. It's time now, again, for No Talking Points. The Trayvon Martin murder case got just about everybody talking about race, and not just specifically how it related to the case. It got some, many on the political right, wondering why the so-called liberal media wasn't talking about other problems in the black community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDY MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Let's talk about race. Let's talk about black-on-black violence. DAVID WEBB, HOST \"THE DAVID WEBB SHOW\": The outrage that I have is in the lack of really the national attention to what is an epidemic of crime in the black community committed largely by blacks. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: Why aren't we talking about it? Good question. Actually, that's not a good question. We talked about it many times on this show and on CNN. It's actually a good deflection as I've said a number of times to a number of guests here on CNN and also on the radio. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: David, do not that false equivalent. That is not -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not trying to equivocate -- LEMON: But, listen, crime happens all the time and because a crime happens, it does not mean that you should shift the focus from what happened here. Let's stick to this particular point so continue and let's talk about this case. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On this case -- (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: So, that's the reason I didn't want to discuss at length crime in the African-American community or how to fix other ills that seem to be plaguing the community in general. But now that the jury has reached one that everyone must accept it's time now for some tough love on the subject. Someone on another network got the chance to go first because I couldn't go during the week. I'm only here on the weekend, so listen to this -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL O'REILLY, FOX NEWS HOST: The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration of the African- American family. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: He's got a point. In fact, he's got more than a point. Bill? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs. Nobody forces them to do that, again, it is a personal decision. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: He is right about that, too. But in my estimation, he doesn't go far enough. Because black people, if you really want to fix the problem, here's just five things that you should think about doing. Here's number five, and if this doesn't apply to you, if you're not doing this, then it doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Here's number five. Pull up your pants. Some people, a lot of them black, gave me flak for saying that recently on \"The Wendy Williams Show.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: If you're sagging, I mean -- I think it's your self-esteem that is sagging and who you are as a person it's sagging. Young people need to be taught respect and there are rules. (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: Sagging pants, whether Justin Bieber or No-name Derek around the way, walking around with your ass and your underwear showing is not OK. In fact, it comes from prison when they take away belts from the prisoners so that they can't make a weapon. And then it evolved into which role a prisoner would have during male-on-male prison sex. The one with the really low pants is the submissive one. You get my point? Number four now is the n-word. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAY-Z, RAPPER: For our generation what we did was we took the word and we took the power out of that word. CHRIS ROCK, COMEDIAN/ACTOR: We took this word, and we made it into poetry. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEMON: I understand poetic license, but consider this: I hosted a special on the n-word, suggesting that black people stop using it and that entertainers stop deluding yourselves or themselves and others that you're somehow taking the word back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: By promoting the use of that word when it's not germane to the conversation, have you ever considered that you may be just perpetuating the stereotype the master intended acting like a nigger? (END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: A lot of African-Americans took offense to that, too. I wonder if I gave the right advice, I really did. But confirmation came the very next day on my way home when I exited the subway in 125th Street in Harlem. This little kid in a school uniform no older than seven years old, he was crying his eyes out as he walked down the sidewalk with his mother. I'm going to be honest here, she turned to me, and she said \"I'm sick of you. You act like an old ass man, stop all that crying, nigger.\" Is that taking the word back? Think about that. Now number three. Respect where you live. Start small by not dropping trash, littering in your own communities. I've lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life, I rarely, if ever, witnessed people littering. I live in Harlem now, it's an historically black neighborhood, every single day I see adults and children dropping their trash on the ground when a garbage can is just feet away. Just being honest here. Number two, finish school. You want to break the cycle of poverty? Stop telling kids they're acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English. A high school dropout makes on average $19,000 a year, a high school graduate makes $28,000 a year, a college graduate makes $51,000 a year. Over the course of a career, a college grad will make nearly $1 million more than a high school graduate. That's a lot of money. And number one, and probably the most important, just because you can have a baby, it doesn't mean you should. Especially without planning for one or getting married first. More than 72 percent of children in the African-American community are born out of wedlock. That means absent fathers. And the studies show that lack of a male role model is an express train right to prison and the cycle continues. So, please, black folks, as I said if this doesn't apply to you, I'm not talking to you. Pay attention to and think about what has been presented in recent history as acceptable behavior. Pay close attention to the hip-hop and rap culture that many of you embrace. A culture that glorifies everything I just mentioned, thug and reprehensible behavior, a culture that is making a lot of people rich, just not you. And it's not going to. That said, though, the political right is not off the hook. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN POWERS, DAILY BEAST COLUMNIST: If conservatives are so concerned about black-on-black crime, it's a little concerning the only time I hear them talking about it is when they want to stick it to the black community.

{"message": "As expected, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, has announced that he is running for president. And we already know what his campaign will be about: faith in miracles. Some of these miracles will involve things that youre liable to read in the Bible. But if he wins the Republican nomination, his campaign will probably center on a more secular theme: the alleged economic miracle in Texas, which, its often asserted, sailed through the Great Recession almost unscathed thanks to conservative economic policies. And Mr. Perry will claim that he can restore prosperity to America by applying the same policies at a national level. So what you need to know is that the Texas miracle is a myth, and more broadly that Texan experience offers no useful lessons on how to restore national full employment. Its true that Texas entered recession a bit later than the rest of America, mainly because the states still energy-heavy economy was buoyed by high oil prices through the first half of 2008.

{"message": "-- This is a transcript of the interview ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos conducted with President Barack Obama on November 12, 2015 at the White House. STEPHANOPOULOS: Okay, Mr. President, thank you for doing this. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Great to be here, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's talk about ISIS to begin with. Did they bring down that Russian plane? OBAMA: Well, we don't know that yet. It is a possibility STEPHANOPOULOS: Just a possibility? OBAMA: Well, we don't know. I think we're still looking at all the details. Any kind of aviation tragedy like this requires a lot of forensic work. It becomes more difficult when we're not actively involved on the ground. We are offering full cooperation with the Egyptians, with the Russians and others. But a lot of this is peace work. But there's a possibility that they may have taken place. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of the intelligence community seems to think it's more of a probability. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence Committee thinks it is. And he told me last week that this would mean that ISIS has fully eclipsed Al Qaeda as the greatest terror threat in the world. Is that right? OBAMA: Well, number one, I think it's premature, but it is a possibility. Number two, what we've known for a long time, since the duration of my presidency and before that, is that a small network of people if they've got some skills and bomb making capabilities can carry out some big damage. And this is why we have ramped up our aviation security not just here in the United States but overseas. If there's a carrier coming here, then we're working with that airlines and that airport to make sure that they've got certain procedures. Now, we don't fly directly over the Sinai to the United States, and as a consequence we don't have those same arrangements at those airports. But this is something that we have known is a consistent vulnerability in this modern era. And that's part of the reason why we invest so much in not only putting safeguards in place but also learning each time there's an incident like this to see how this might have happened. STEPHANOPOULOS: But if ISIS with affiliates in so many countries right now, even Afghanistan, if they decided now to go to international terror, that's a game changer, isn't it? OBAMA: Well I have to tell you, George AQAP in Yemen Al Qaeda in Yemen we know has had plots consistently over the last several years to try to bring down an airliner. I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel. If there's a crack in the system, then they potentially can exploit it. And they are looking for these cracks to exploit. What makes ISIL the challenge that it is right now is primarily the fact that they're occupying territory in two countries that aren't governed effectively in those spaces. All right, so in Iraq, when you get into the Sunni areas of Iraq there's not strong governance. In Syria, obvious in the midst of civil war, there is a total breakdown of order. And their ability to sustain themselves in those areas are the primary and principle concern we have. STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you think it means OBAMA: with respect to ISIL.

{"message": "U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop. The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and \"fight to rein in the EPA.\" Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements. In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter \"Crying over spilt milk.\" \"What do spilt milk and oil have in common?\" he wrote. \"Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPAs reasoning is that milk contains a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil. It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill.\" With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim. Beth Breeding, Griffiths press secretary, said her bosss information came from the EPAs website. So we went there. Right away, we found problems with Griffiths claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a \"new ruling,\" as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years. The EPA site says \"since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of oil from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress.\" The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk. So whats new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month. The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Thats the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Heres what the regulation says: \"EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance,\" or similar state laws. Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPAs oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell \"raw,\" or unpasteurized, milk, so the states dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards. Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk. Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms. Lets review our findings. Griffith claimed a \"new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply\" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies. In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all.

{"message": "Share FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.  Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trumps widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public. Thats largely because Trump himself hasnt talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didnt respond to our request for more information, and doesnt seem to have answered other media outlets requests, either. Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances hes described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones. The Facts Congress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA. Advertisement The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.) After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses. That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property. Advertisement Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools. Share this article Share The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools  you have to  and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. Theres no more gun-free zones. His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal. Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds? Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well? Advertisement Trumps answer was still devoid of specifics: Im going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. Im also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and its gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, This is incredible. This is perfect. Theres no guns in there. Im the only one thats going to have guns. You cant do it. Im going to work with the states, and if I have to, Im going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if Im allowed to do that. . . . But we cant have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, We are a gun-free zone. And then you have these crazy people out there saying, Boy, this is the most incredible thing, and thats happening. The Pinocchio Test Trump hasnt offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics arent clear yet. Trump said he would work with the states but that he would override the states if I have to. Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.

{"message": "It's amazing but true: we can prevent terror suspects from boarding an airplane, but the FBI doesn't have the power to block them from buying dynamite or an AK-47. I believe strongly that they should. And so do the 500 mayors who are members of our bi-partisan coalition of Mayor Against Illegal Guns. Advertisement It is time to close the \"Terror Gap\" in our gun laws. This morning I will be testifying at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security Committee about the easy access that terror suspects have to guns and explosives. I wanted to share with lawmakers the hard-earned perspective New Yorkers have on this national security risk. The car bomb the New York City Police Department found in Times Square on Saturday night was not the only attempted terrorist attack on our city since 9/11 -- far from it. And sadly, it won't be the last. Since 1990, there have been more than 20 terrorists plots -- or actual attacks -- against our city. In the last year alone, the NYPD -- working closely with federal authorities -- prevented two major planned attacks on our City. The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx. The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system. Advertisement And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York. Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another. At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport. He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts. And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13. We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism. The Bush Administration first proposed closing the Terror Gap in 2007. But because Congress has failed to act on that proposal, people who may want to do our country harm have been able to buy guns and explosives. Today, the Government Accountability Office has released new data showing that suspects on the terrorism watch lists were able to buy guns and explosives from licensed US dealers 1,119 times between 2004 and 2010. That is a serious and dangerous breach of national security. That's why the more than 500 mayors in Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a coalition that I co-chair with Mayor Tom Menino of Boston, support legislation to close the Terror Gap. This issue is a centerpiece of the coalition's fight to strengthen the federal background check system. Today, we have launched a new website --   -- to help educate Congress and the public about the Terror Gap and its consequences. Advertisement This legislation would give FBI agents the authority to block terror suspects from buying guns and explosives. It would also give them the ability to make exceptions when they determine that blocking a sale might tip off a suspect who is under investigation. And the bill also allows those on the list to appeal their status to the Justice Department -- and challenge the determination in court. Attorney General Eric Holder supported closing the Terror Gap in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. And so does the vast majority of Americans. A December poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz found that 82% of NRA members, and 86% of other gun owners, support closing the Terror Gap. To learn more and take action, please visit:   In New York City, we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent another terrorist attack. Under Commissioner Kelly's leadership, the NYPD has developed one of the world's most advanced counter-terrorism programs. One thousand of our best officers work on counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts every day. Advertisement A key element of any smart counter-terrorism strategy is to make it harder for terrorists to strike. That's why air passengers walk through metal detectors. That's why our police officers randomly check bags in the subway. That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations. And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives.", "title": "Terror Suspects Are Buying Guns - and the FBI Can't Stop Them", "label": "real", "id": 490}
{"message": "Obama Demands Investigation into Subprime Loan Discrimination Thursday, October 18, 2007 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Amy Brundage, 202 228 5511 Asks FTC to examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high-priced loans WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras, calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination. According to recent studies, and an editorial in the New York Times, there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers. Hundreds of thousands of African American families  many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans  could potentially lose their homes in the coming years. In the letter, Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products, whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, and whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers. The text of the letter is below: October 18, 2007 The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras Federal Trade Commission 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580 Dear Commissioner Majoras: I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday's New York Times which begins: \"Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom, black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers, even after controlling for factors such as income, loan size and property location.\" (\"Subprime in Black and White,\" The New York Times, October 17, 2007) In reality, such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods. More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns. Last year, for example, the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans, minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores, loan to value ratios, and other underwriting criteria. And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high-income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans. Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue. I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination. Among other things, the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices. Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers. Some practices, such as yield-spread premiums, which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products, or prepayment penalties, which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles, appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers. With an estimated 53% of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans, and more than 60% of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties, the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of African American families  many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans  are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years. I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions: 1) Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria. 2) Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair. Specifically, whether the disclosure of yield-spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers. 3) Whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options, including those regulated by the Federal government, in predominantly minority communities even for higher-income borrowers, has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building. Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream.

{"message": "While the school choice movement can trace its lineage to the very genesis of the United States civil society, the concept of parental choice in education began to more fully mature through the work of Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman. Just one year after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, Friedman explained a plan for student school vouchers that would enhance and diversify K-12 education across the country. Friedmans plan, and much of the scholarship that it inspired, focused on the means by which all students would have access to equal and excellent educational opportunities. In 1990, the movement took a substantial step forward with the creation of the nations first publicly financed urban school choice program, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.(link to page with state choice programs) Several similar initiatives were established in the years following, utilizing both the voucher and the tax credit model, with publicly funded and supported choice programs developing in areas such as Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Cleveland and Ohio. With the development of these programs came the institution of multiple state-based and national organizations (link to allies page) whose function was the protection and expansion of school choice. In 2002, the movement earned a momentous triumph with the U.S. Supreme Courts decision on the constitutionality of the Cleveland scholarship program in the 2002 Zelman v. Simmons-Harris decision. Throughout this period of tremendous growth, it became increasingly clear that the school choice movement would need to develop a national infrastructure and vision in order to achieve sustainable success. With this in mind, scholars, allies, philanthropists and activists discussed the creation of a single, national, high capacity initiative that could lead school choice into its most exciting era. After significant research and planning, on May 17, 2004  the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education  this initiative became a reality, as the Alliance for School Choice was launched. The Alliance for School Choice is the only national policy organization devoted exclusively to promoting school choice programs that expand private sector opportunities, primarily for economically disadvantaged children. Together with its sister lobbying organization, Advocates for School Choice  and in close collaboration with state and national allies  the Alliance is devoted to assisting local efforts to implement successful and transformative school choice programs throughout the country. The Alliance for School Choice is the legacy of many years of advancing the cause of educational opportunity. Standing on the shoulders of giants such as Milton Friedman, strengthened by the pioneering work of countless allies, and empowered by the promises set forth in Brown v. Board of Education, the Alliance is committed to the work of leading school choice into a new era  one that will ultimately see the vision of educational opportunity become a reality.", "title": "School Choice FAQ", "label": "real", "id": 493}

{"message": "Expanding Opportunity  #KempForum16 Paul Ryan  Follow 5 min read  Jan 9, 2016 -- 8 Listen Share Lets get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16. I just wanted to say a few words about why were here today. And one reason why Im here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty. So I couldnt think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century. Weve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I dont think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, youre just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago. Im not saying we havent made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty  that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem? It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation  or not having enough money. We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, weve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in peoples budgets: health care,child care, energy, education  with almost no coordination among them. Heres the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you dont make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits. And because weve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and youll lose a ton. So we think weve been filling holes. But weve actually been building a trap. And thats because poverty is about more than deprivation; its about isolation. There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They dont have the support they need to grow, whether its a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss. What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor. Thats why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Dont just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty. Dont measure success based on inputs. Measure the results. And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington. It is the people in our communities  the people with credibility. Theyre the ones who can break through. And Im not saying just cut money for the safety net. Id say spend the same amount of money we do now  because this isnt about saving money; its about saving lives. What Im saying is, dont minimize; customize. Take the money were spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each persons needs. And whatever you do,encourage work  because thats how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow. Theyll not only have enough money; theyll be able to make enough money to get off assistance. The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities  theyre the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines. Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, Why do you care about this? Youre Republicans. I remind them, Well, were Americans too. We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesnt determine the outcome of your life. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself. But a lot of people dont think thats true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are. And its not enough to pay your taxes and think, Government is going to take care of this. We all have to get involved. And I know its easy to get discouraged. But what Ive learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; theyre already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not theyre right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America. So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America.", "title": "Expanding Opportunity  #KempForum16", "label": "real", "id": 496}

{"message": "'); //--> E-mail | Print | Comments | Request Reprints | E-Mail Newsletters | My Yahoo! | RSS Blank Slate Is The End In Sight For Supermax? Jeffrey Ian Ross When you think about it, its really no different than any other public works project: You need prisons, you build prisons. You need better ones, you design and build better ones. When prison populations fall--well, thats a more difficult matter. How do we keep an appropriate number of prisons on line and available to house--and hopefully rehabilitate--a prison population that is in flux? Even with violent-crime rates trending downward nationwide, how do we prepare for a potential rise in the numbers of extremely violent offenders who require special facilities--like the highly touted Supermax prisons? The answer is the same as it would be for schools, shopping malls and highways: You build them based on your current and expected needs. And you hope theyll be used. In 1994, the federal government opened its first Supermax prison in Florence, Colo., dubbed the Alcatraz of the Rockies. In the years that followed, many state departments of corrections built their own. Supermax prisons, also known as Special (or Security) Handling Units or Control Handling Units, are known for their strict lockdown policies, lack of amenities and prisoner isolation techniques. Escapes from Supermaxes are so rare they're statistically inconsequential. However, as good as these prisons are at keeping our worst offenders in check, the purpose of the Supermax is in flux. Originally set up to house the most violent, hardened and escape-prone criminals, Supermaxes are instead used for leaders of criminal organizations and gangs, serial killers, persistent rule-breakers and political criminals like spies and terrorists. The Supermaxes maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Marion, Ill., and Florence, Colo., incarcerate a total of 1,710 people, including such notable criminals as \"Unabomber\" Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols. In the United States alone, some 7 million people are under the control of the criminal justice system. About 2.1 million are behind bars, while another 4.9 million are on probation, parole or some other type of community correction. Only a fraction of these populations find themselves in a Supermax facility. In 1998, approximately 20,000 inmates were locked up in this type of prison, representing less than 2% of all the men and women currently incarcerated across the country. Most of the Supermaxes in the United States, such as the federal facility in Florence, are brand new or nearly so. Others are simply free-standing prisons that were retrofitted. According to a study by the Urban Institute, the per-cell cost of a Supermax is about $75,000 annually, compared to $25,000 for each cell in an ordinary state prison. You can see the problem: We have plenty of super-expensive Supermax facilities--two-thirds of the states now have them. But they were designed when crime was considered a growing problem, and now we have a remarkably lower violent-crime rate showing no real signs a turn for the worse. What to do? How do we use these pricey islands of ultimate correction? No self-respecting state director of the corrections or correctional planner will admit that the Supermax concept was a mistake. And youd be wrong to think that these prisons can be replaced by something drastically less costly. But prison experts are beginning to realize that, just like a shrinking city that finds itself with too many schools or fire departments, the Supermax model must be made more flexible in order to justify its size and budget. One solution is to house different types of prisoners. Earlier this month, Wisconsin Department of Corrections officials announced that over the past 16 years, the states Supermax facility in Boscobel--built to the tune of $47.5 million (in 1990 dollars) and with a capacity of 500 inmates--has always stood at 100 cells less than its capacity. It will now be housing maximum security prisoners--serious offenders, but a step down from the worst of the worst. The Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center, aka the Baltimore Supermax prison, opened in 1989 at a cost of $21 million (in 1989 dollars) with room for 288 inmates. Like its cousin in Wisconsin, the structure has never been at capacity. Not only does it hold the state's most dangerous prisoners, it also houses 100 or so inmates who are working their way through the federal courts, and serves as the home for Marylands ten death row convicts. Converting cells is one approach, but not the only one. Other ideas include building more regional Supermaxes, and filling them by shifting populations from other states. This would allow us to completely empty out a given Supermax, and then close it down or convert it to another use. Theres also the possibility that some elements of the Supermax model could be combined with the approaches of traditional prisons, creating a hybrid that serves a wider population. But different types of prisoners would have to be kept well away from each other--a logistical problem of no small concern. Its worth considering that the Supermax model--which includes prisoner isolation for 23 out of every 24 hours a day--may be serving as a deterrent to some violent criminals, a kind of brightly lit billboard that advertises the life of rather extreme measures they are facing. Theres no way to quantify that, but its not out of the realm of possibility. Whatever the solution or solutions to the issue of Supermax costs, its important to remember that an empty jail cell of any kind is an indicator to our society of one truth: We must be doing something right.

Protection activities focus on people detained by Iraqi authorities, including Kurdistan regional authorities. ICRC delegates visit tens of thousands of detainees throughout the country, talk to them in private, and provide the relevant authorities with confidential feedback on the detainees treatment and living conditions. The visits also enable detainees to keep in touch with their loved ones, through Red Cross Messages, distributed in cooperation with the Iraqi Red Crescent Society to families in Iraq and abroad. The ICRC, in close cooperation with the respective governments, is also following the fate of thousands of missing persons as a result of the several conflicts in the region, and provides support and expertise in forensic medicine as well as in conducting joint excavation missions. Assistance activities, which focus on remote and neglected areas prone to violence, involve helping IDPs and residents restore their livelihood, with a focus on households headed by women, supporting primary health care centres and physical rehabilitation centres through the provision of material and training of medical personal and repairing and upgrading water, sanitation, health and detention infrastructure. The ICRC also continues to promote IHL among weapon bearers and to support the Iraqi Red Crescent Society in building up its capacities in the field of First Aid and Disaster Management. In a nutshell, in 2012 the ICRC: - further extended its operational out-reach into remote areas prone to violence in the centre of the country and the disputed territories; - conducted 231 visits to 109 places of detention holding approximately 38'161 detainees under Iraqi central or Kurdish authorities; - contributed to progress made in clarifying the fate of people missing as a result of the 1990-91 Gulf War and the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, facilitating seven joint operations to exhume and transfer human remains; - assisted 11'857 women heading household, amputees and farmer in rural areas prone to violence (with 57'513 dependents) with livelihood support projects, cash assistance and income-generating projects; - improved access to water, physical rehabilitation and primary health care for 1'844'522 residents, IDPs and returnees through the rehabilitation of water and health infrastructure, material support, training and coaching; - assisted 36'264 residents, refugees, IDPs and returnees with emergency assistance (food, non-food and water). - continued to provide, along with the International Federation, institutional support to the Iraqi Red Crescent.

{"message": "President Barack goes one-on-one with David Gregory about passing health care reform and the current tone of the debate. Then, the Republican response with Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Plus, a political roundtable: The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson  and  Politico's Roger Simon. DAVID GREGORY: Let me ask you about another important issue facing you and your administration, and that is Afghanistan. We've now been in Afghanistan for eight years. The Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan after ten years. Are we committed to this war for an indefinite period of time? Or do you think, in your mind, is there a deadline for withdrawal? PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't have a deadline for withdrawal. But I'm certainly not somebody who believes in indefinite occupations of other countries. Keep in mind what happened when I came in. We had been adrift, I think, when it came to our Afghanistan strategy. And what I said was that we are going to do a top to bottom review of what's taking place there. Not just a one time review, but we're gonna do a review before the election in Afghanistan, and then we're gonna do another review after the election. And we are gonna see how this is fitting what, I think, is our core goal. Which is to go after the folks who killed the 3,000 Americans during 9/11, and who are still plotting to kill us, al Qaeda. How do we dismantle them, disrupt them, destroy them? Now, getting our strategy right in Afghanistan and in Pakistan are both important elements of that. But that's our goal. And I want to stay focused on that. And and so, right now, what's happened is that we've had an election in Afghanistan. It did not go as smoothly as I think we would have hoped. And there are some serious issues in terms of how that how the election was conducted in some parts of the country. But we've had that election. We now finally have the 21,000 troops in place that I had already ordered to go. DAVID GREGORY: Are you skeptical about more troops? About sending more troops? PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, can I just say this? I am I have to exercise skepticism anytime I send a single young man or woman in uniform into harm's way. Because I'm the one who's answerable to their parents if they don't come home. So I have to ask some very hard questions anytime I send our troops in. The question that I'm asking right now is to our military, to General McChrystal, to General Petraeus, to all our national security apparatus, is whether it's troops who are already there, or any troop request in the future, how does this advance America's national security interests? How does it make sure that al Qaeda and its extremist allies cannot attack the United States homeland, our allies, our troops who are based in Europe? That's the question that I'm constantly asking because that's the primary threat that we went there to deal with. And if if supporting the Afghan national government, and building capacity for their army, and securing certain provinces advances that strategy, then we'll move forward. But, if it doesn't, then I'm not interested in just being in Afghanistan for the sake of being in Afghanistan or saving face or, in some way you know, sending a message that America is here for for the duration. I think it's important that we match strategy to resources. What I'm not also gonna do, though, is put the resource question before the strategy question. Until I'm satisfied that we've got the right strategy I'm not gonna be sending some young man or woman over there- beyond what we already have. DAVID GREGORY: On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All Star game wearing your Chicago White Sox (LAUGHTER) jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?

And for him to convey a message of dont slow down, I think was a good message.

This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasnt yet escaped from a full-blown investigation. Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. Its about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country.

{"message": "Sharing is caring! Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest At approximately 9:18 a.m. on Wednesday, attorneys for Hillary Rodham Clinton filed an Action For Divorce with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County, according to documents obtained by Christian Times Newspaper. Citing irreconcilable differences, the former Democratic nominee for President apparently is seeking a divorce from her longtime husband former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton is named as the defendant in the legal filing, and Hillarys signature appears beside her listing as the plaintiff. The plaintiffs signature is often included in these types of filings to certify and expedite the legal process. According to the filing obtained by CTN, the couple has a previously agreed-upon separation agreement or stipulation that will govern the manner in which the marital property is to be distributed in the event the divorce is finalized. It is unclear at this time what that agreement specifically covers. CTN has censored the couples address and the contact information for Hillarys attorney in the respect of their privacy. At this time, the Clintons are not commenting on the breaking news of their imminent divorce. The Clintons got married on October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas in the living room of their new red brick home. 15 of their closest friends and family were present, and the reception took place in their backyard. The couples marriage has been a mystery for years after it was discovered that Bill Clinton carried on multiple affairs while Governor of Arkansas, President of the United States, and even after his time in public office. It has been alleged in the past that the couple has a purely professional relationship and that they havent slept in the same bed for years source", "title": "BREAKING: Hilary Clinton Filed For Divorce In New York Courts!", "label": "fake", "id": 503}
{"message": "62.1k SHARES Share Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be. Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obamas administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move. The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administrations problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that? The funny thing, a White House official said, is that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day. But I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel, he went on, no one in the press would say it was her staffs fault. That is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better. What do you think about this whole mess?

According to reports, US Federal Grand Jury had been impaneled to hear testimony from witnesses presented before it by FBI investigators and/or US Attorneys. On July 7th, the report continues, a massive explosion occurred that obliterated a two-story house. The shock wave jolted people from their beds as much as a mile and a half away. As per standard protocol and procedures, this report details, SVR analysts, in their replying to the MoDs request for information about this event, conducted a database search of the two persons named as having been killed in this explosion Carole Paladino, age 72, and her husband John Paladino, age 73with, and very surprisingly to them, a SVR database target hit on Carole Paladino being revealed as she had previously been identified by SVR analysts as being a probable witness against the Clinton Foundation., Now deceased Carole Paladino was the lead school nurse for Millville Public Schools located in Cumberland County, New Jerseyand whose inclusion in the SVRs database of potential witnesses against the Clinton Foundation was due to her being a central identified and named figure in the creation of a document titled Training Protocols For The Emergency Administration Of Epinephrine for the New Jersey Department of Education. Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), this report explains, is a hormone used to treat anaphylaxisthat is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause deathand whose administering of is done via a medical device known as an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen)and that the Carole Paladino collaborated on report for its emergency administration led New Jersey to pass a law requiring all schools in their State, both public and private, to purchase itand their passing another law allowing New Jersey school nurses to, also, use EpiPens without parental permission. Whether knowingly, or not knowingly, Carole Paladino, by her being a main target person in the plot to force all New Jersey schools to purchase EpiPens, she became embroiled in one of the largest medical scams ever known in US historythat began when the American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company Mylan N.V. suddenly began funneling money to the Clinton Foundationand that nearly immediately after which, saw Gayle Conelly Manchin take over as the head of the National Association of State Boards of Educationand who spearheaded an unprecedented effort that encouraged States to require schools to purchase medical devices that fight life-threatening allergic reactionsthat, in turn, helped pave the way for Mylan N.V., maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses offices throughout the United Stateswith New Jersey is one of the 11 States drafting laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors be bought by schoolsand that the Obama-Clinton regime conspired with using their EpiPen Law that gave funding preference to States that did what Gayle Conelly Manchin told them to do. Unbeknownst to the American people, this report notes, is that Gayle Conelly Manchin is the mother of Heather Breschwho, in 2012, right after her mother took control of the National Association of State Boards of Education and began her campaign to force schools to buy EpiPensbecame the CEO of EpiPen maker Mylan N.V.with Heather Bresch, upon taking control, raising the price of EpiPens over 400% to $600 per dose and skyrocketing her personal worth to over $27 millionand whose protection for this vile plot was provided by her father, and Gayle Conelly Manchins husband, Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchin. To an even greater scandal-catastrophe awaiting Hillary Clinton, as it dwarfs too near insignificance her EpiPen one, this report further notes, is her active and knowing participation in the United States opioid crisisthat the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns whose drug overdoses attributed to in the US have increased by 13.3 percent from August 2016 to August 2017, and now total 67,344 deaths per yearnearly all of which were deliberately caused by Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharmawho, after funneling tens-of-millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, saw the Obama-Clinton regime to a blind eye to their flooding of America with opioidsand as exampled by Democratic Party US Senator Joe Manchins home State of West Virginia being flooded with more than 780 million opioid pills, that roughly equals 433 pills for every man, woman, and child in his State. This report, after describing the horrific opioid crisis in America, concludes with SVR analysts noting that this past week, also, provided an explanation as to why the FBI task force investigating Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has been increasing their electronic communications with the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Tennesseeand that is due to a shocking court case currently underway in Knoxville, Tennesseethat was brought against the Clinton Foundation bribed pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III on behalf of the citizens of his Stateand whose shocking to the conscious just released, by order of the court, documents stunningly reveal: Purdues own records show company founders and executives pressed its sales team to push Tennessee doctors to prescribe deadly dosages of Oxycontin on a long-term basis while lying to doctors about the dangers. Purdue leaders lied to the medical community, politicians and the public not only about the dangers of Oxycontin but created a false narrative  that long-term use of opioids didnt create addicts but instead caused pseudo addictive symptoms. The groups sought to convince the public they had a right to opioids.

The company has come under fire recently from religious groups for its new transgender bathroom policy. The King James Bible has been available for purchase at Target stores ever since the company was founded as Goodfellow Dry Goods back in 1902. Speaking with CNBC, Cornell cited recent protests from what he calls religious extremists as the reason to pull the bible from its shelves. Target will no longer cater to religious extremists, said Cornell. If that means removing the bible from our shelves, then so be it. Cornell said the big box chain is sticking to its guns regarding their bathroom policy, and will be phasing out anything having to do with religion.

{"message": "The death toll in one Ohio town continues to rise as 60 people were just found dead overnight and emergency crews cant keep up with the calls that continue to pour in. President Trump had warned of what was coming to prevent these deaths and now its time to take urgent action as hes announced in a shocking message to Americans. With all the focus recently being on Chicago and the immense amount of shooting deaths there are in that war zone every day, a bigger issue has presented itself just a couple states away in Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner has confirmed that 60 people died in February from the same alarming cause, which brings the total deaths from this to 109 this year for just this one small part of Ohio. However, the issue is widespread across the country and only getting worse, which is why Donald Trump wants to do something about it now. Fatal drug overdoses now surpass car deaths in America thanks to the increased use, availability, and abuse of heroin, fentanyl or a combination of the two that come into the country from wide open borders and unchecked immigrants. With each month comes a new record number of deaths from this drug not just in Ohio, but nationwide. Februarys number could increase because seven cases are still awaiting further toxicology testing. Of the fatalities last month, 36 were Cleveland residents, Fox 8 reported. Trump is well aware of the opioid epidemic that claimed 52,000 lives in 2015, which was the most amount of overdoses in a single year in U.S. History. This is part of the reason hes wanting to crack down so hard on the border. During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, the President said that he will build a great, great wall along our southern border  in part to dramatically slow the flow of narcotics pouring into the U.S. at an unprecedented rate. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop, Trump promised in his speech, Vox reported. Although a wall wont stop it completely, hes the first to address the epidemic thats gotten worse while it was ignored the last eight years. While Trump was criticized for his comment that the wall would stop the flow of drugs, its a step in the right direction and hes at least ready to do something about it, whereas his predecessor was not. America does not need more of what comes in illegally over the border, whether its people, drugs, or both. Join Americas Patriots Media And Share This Article Now!

{"message": "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdains scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite. It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this persons tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didnt include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn. Fact-checking largely didnt begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there dont seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets. CNN has also released a statement: The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation. But that still doesnt really verify that anything occurred. @solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an  RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016 @solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa  RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016 The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Its a layup for body-part puns. This is exactly how fake news spreads But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, its clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context. The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign.

{"message": "CNN  First lady Melania Trump underwent kidney surgery Monday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center near Washington, DC, according to a statement from her office. Trump had been experiencing an issue with her kidney that her office described as benign but requiring medical attention. This morning, first lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure to treat a benign kidney condition. The procedure was successful, and there were no complications, the first ladys communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement. Mrs. Trump is at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will likely remain there for the duration of the week. The first lady looks forward to a full recovery so she can continue her work on behalf of children everywhere, Grisham wrote. President Donald Trump remained in the White House during Melania Trumps surgery. He tweeted just after 5 p.m. Monday that he was heading to hospital to visit his wife in Marine One. Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! Trump tweeted. Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018 Trump, who turned 48 last month, had surgery at Walter Reed in nearby Bethesda, Maryland, on Monday morning. She is the first US first lady to undergo such a serious medical procedure while in the White House since Nancy Reagan had a mastectomy in October 1987. Rosalynn Carter underwent surgery to remove a benign lump from her breast in April 1977. Weeks after Betty Ford became first lady, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy in September 1974. The first lady did not move to Washington until six months into the administration, choosing to let their son, Barron, finish the 2017 school year in New York. More recently, Melania Trump has had a more public profile. On April 24, she and the President hosted the first official state dinner of the Trump administration, an event that was planned and executed primarily by the first lady. Trump was responsible for every aspect of the formal dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, from the hand-selected ivory tablecloths to the menu, which the first lady designed to meld American food with French influence. During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier. The hat set the internet ablaze, with references and comparisons to Beyonc, the suffragette movement and even television character Olivia Pope of Scandal. On May 7, Trump, a relatively private first lady by comparison to her most recent predecessors, was once again front and center, this time to unveil her formal platform, Be Best. She kicked off the initiative with a Rose Garden speech lasting 11 minutes, the longest public speaking engagement during her 16-month tenure as first lady. Be Best is a three-pronged platform with a focus on opioid addiction and families, general physical and emotional well-being of children, and kindness and safety for kids using social media. The latter caused a firestorm of controversy because it encompasses cyberbullying, a tactic that Melania Trumps husband, the President, has often been accused of fueling. In March, the first lady addressed the criticism she has faced by taking up the issue during opening remarks to a meeting she convened at the White House for tech industry leaders from Google, Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and others. I am well-aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic, she said. I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me from doing what I know is right. Melania Trump has also appeared with her husband several times in recent weeks. He was seated in the front row during her Be Best speech, after which he made remarks praising her commitment to helping children, and he was again second to speak, after his wife, during the Military Mothers and Spouses Ceremony on Friday in the White House East Room. Shes become a very, very popular first lady. Im reading that  They love Melania, the President said.

{"message": "Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails and Russias involvement in the Trump campaign, has said hes willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trumps effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation. Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBIs conduct during the 2016 election. Strzoks lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him. The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, No. No he wont. Well stop it. The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with specific investigative decisions, but said that comment and others implies a willingness to take official action. Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldnt be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trumps odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that theres no question that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation. Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts. Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that thats a topic, and his own integrity. Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector generals findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trumps allies from calling for Muellers immediate suspension. Why was the FBIs sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry  and  Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that well stop Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018 The highest level of bias Ive ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer. Trey Gowdy on the FBIs own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isnt it?  Donald J.

Regardless of all the backlash, Stephanie Wilkinson has doubled down and is now claiming she does not repent what she did Friday. All this mess started when Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, together with her Husband along with six other friends decided to go out to dinner this past Friday night in the Red Hen Restaurant. As Sanders along with the rest inside her celebration nibbled in what we can only surmise as mediocre crackers and cheese, the owner of the restaurant has been called to the institution where she asked Sanders to return to the terrace with her. When they got to the patio Wilkerson told her the restaurant hadcertain criteria likehonesty, and empathy, and collaboration. So she asked Sanders to depart. She agreed because Sanders is a lady. She gathered up her stuff and left, together with the rest of her celebration. Vice noted: But despite all the backlash shes gotten from the right, Stephanie Wilkinson says she does not regret a thing. We simply felt there are moments in time when folks need to live their own convictions. This appeared to be one. When Sanders came to the Red Hen along with her husband along with six other people on Friday night, the boxer called Wilkinson to mention the team wasa little concerned, Wilkinson told the Post. She headed to the restaurant, andwhile Sanders and her friends munched on cheeseboardscalled the team to a huddle in the kitchen, and asked if they wanted Sanders to leave. According to the Article, a handful of her workers are gay, and many others are revulsed by Sanders treatment of this emergency at the boundary. They wanted her gone. Wilkinson took Sanders out into the patio and asked her to leave, telling her why the restaurant hadcertain criteria likehonesty, and compassion, and collaboration, Wilkinson told the Post. Sanders agreed to proceed, gathered up her things, and headed out, followed by the remainder of her party, whose meal Wilkinson comped. Following the White House Press Secretary identified the place by name on Twitter, President Trump called itfilthy, and a army of his assistants got busy screwing with its businessbeginning a campaign to make a bunch of bogus dinner reservations and tanking its score on Yelp. I always had a guideline, if a restaurant is filthy on the outside, its dirty on the inside! The restaurants Yelp page has been bombarded with over 11,000 one-star reviews, leaving it in a sound one-and-a-half. Piggybacking on Trumps dig on the area beingfilthy, several pissed-off reviewers have claimed to have discovered roaches in their food because Sanders was kicked out, but some have compared Wilkinson to a Nazi and called her and her staffun-American hateful bigots. Ive a company, and I want the company to flourish. This feels just like the moment in our democracy when people need to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to maintain their morals. Saturday afternoon the Press Secretary hadnt any difficulty in telling her story and actually named the establishment on Twitter, which was followed by President Trump calling itfilthy on his Twitter page. Which in turn led to a military people deplorables wasting no time whatsoever in creating our feelings heard on social networking, on Yelp and by creating fake dinner reservations in demonstration. The Restaurants Yelp page currently has the company at one star and a half. While on the other side, liberals were pleased to leave this slum a 5-star rating although they threw a hissy fit every time a Christian baker didnt need to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding a few years back.

For decades there have been people that came to the United States illegally, but its only in the past year or so that it seems that people have been doing it just to spite the system. People dont mass organize like this without someone leading the charge. Currently, ahead of all other candidates, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will likely be the next President of Mexico. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO, has been openly telling his people to flood the U.S. border. What AMLO is asking his people is not a surprise He has an actual strategic policy behind his plan. Apparently, he has been planning this for years but nobody really cared to pay attention. AMLOs key economic plan for Mexico is to become wealthy, and recently he has received a broad mainstream Mexican understanding. Conservatives in the U.S. have no idea about Mexicos plan, but the far-left and democratic immigration radicals sure do. Reported by 100percentfedup: Wellat least a leader of Mexico is admitting whats been going on for a loooong time. The radical open borders element on both sides has been welcoming millions of illegals for decades. Yes, decades Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America. La Raza aka The Race is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups: GEORGE SOROSS OPEN BORDER FOUNDATIONS: An inside look at the machinations of the multibillionaire and his mission to destroy national sovereignty. THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador aka AMLO: (From the Daily Caller) [] And soon, very soon  after the victory of our movement  we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world, Obrador said, adding that immigrants must leave their towns and find a life in the United States. He then declared it as a human right we will defend. The Conservative Treehouse warns: It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach. So, AMLOs faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico. From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.

According to the Birmingham Press, polling officials caught what appears to be a van full of illegals who traveled to at least 7 polling locations with fake identification to vote for Moores opponent Doug Jones. Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting, the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon. The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials. Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state. Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for dozens of fake votes around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak. This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore molesting a young woman fail, they try to cheat. This is, of course, similar to a situation in California on Election Day 2016 when illegal aliens were busted trying to vote for Hillary Clinton.

This is a growing position on the left, and I imagine 2020 Democratic presidential aspirants will have to grapple with it, liberal writer and MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted. In January, the idea was endorsed by Brian Fallon, a former top aide to 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and Eric Holder, President Barack Obamas attorney general. The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls. ICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force, Fallon tweeted. Dems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form. Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime. These politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens, Homan said Thursday on Fox News Tucker Carlson Tonight. But the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist. ICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist, Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. But lets not abuse the power. Since then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications. Kamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020, Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. It should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition. He added: She should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization. Mirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- should be asked the same question. PELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS UNJUST AND CRUEL The Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled Its Time to Abolish ICE. The writer accused the agency of being part of an unbridled white-supremacist surveillance state and called it an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Though the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- its time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism, McElwee wrote. Democratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaffs tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk. SESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA Sessions called Californias \"open borders\" policies a radical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted. It cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth, he said.

The crew of the MV Nisshin Maru (), Japans primary whaling vessel and the worlds only whaler factory ship, was forced to leave the deck temporarily as a gas leak was detected within the ships processing factory that resulted in the ship being temporarily disabled all while continuing to carry approximately 1,000 tons of oil. The resulting panic lead members of the ship to jump off the boat before proper emergency procedures were taken and lifeboats had been set to sea. The swimming crew members were then ferociously attacked by a school of killer whales, that decimated a large number of the crew within moments. It was horrific claims Asuka Kumara, a mechanical engineer who witnessed the gruesome scene. The water was red with blood, there were bodies everywhere he recalls in tears. Within 30 minutes of the incident, 16 crew members had disappeared into the ocean. The incident occurred in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, near the South Eastern Coast of South Africa, a controversial area to be whaling as a recent international court ruling has ordered the country to ends its whale hunt in the Antarctic.

{"message": "Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report. The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them. One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Corfman told the Post that Moore touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying. This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation, Moore said. Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trumps warning that Moore was less electable. Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election.  Washington Examiner Stephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of faking things like fake checks for instance According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be fake news, after using mulitple unnamed sources in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check. Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown. Ms. McCrummens criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19  False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless. Ms. McCrummens other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizonas jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction. McCrummen has now found herself a four-time loser in the states criminal courts. She currently resides outside of the jurisdiction of the three states where she committed her crimes. Sean Hannity ripped into the media frenzy over the Judge Moore scandal on his show last night. The left is calling for his head today:   When a reporter has a criminal history that essentially proves she gave false information to pay a debt or for services, shouldnt her character come into question when it comes to making a 40 year old sexual allegation against one of the most hated, Steve Bannon backed conservatives running for office in America, that may help to enhance her career?", "title": "JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of Faking * 100PercentFedUp.com * by Patty McMurray", "label": "fake", "id": 531}
{"message": "For Immediate Release: February 26, 2018 Statement From: Scott Gottlieb, M.D. Espaol The current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this years flu  which may continue to affect Americans into April  were already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next seasons influenza vaccines. As part of this process, were striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this years influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2. As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future. These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what weve learned so far about this seasons vaccines and the steps were taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this years findings and better prepare for future flu seasons. Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2 There are a number of theories on why this seasons vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. Were taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor. While that finding isnt too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined. So why did this seasons vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain? We dont think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this seasons flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this years vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2. However, were working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this seasons vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses. Working to determine the root causes Toward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. Were also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune systems response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging. What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. Were also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this seasons vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings. The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future seasons vaccines should be produced. Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu season While this scientific work is underway, the composition of next seasons flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next seasons flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this years influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this years flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu. In the meantime, this flu season isnt over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctors offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. Its also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs. The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this seasons flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nations food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ###", "title": "Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on FDAs ongoing efforts to help improve effectiveness of influenza vaccines", "label": "fake", "id": 532}

Roof, the first person to be convicted of a federal hate crime and sentenced to the death penalty, was removed from custody in Al Cannon Detention Center in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday and transferred to Terre Haute, prison records show. Terre Haute, a medium-security prison where inmates are put to death by lethal injection, currently houses 1,338 inmates. Dylann Roof is escorted into the court room at the Charleston County Judicial Center in Charleston, South Carolina, April 10, 2017. Grace Beahm/Pool / Reuters In January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war. He also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10. Roof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. Read more about the lethal injection controversy here As of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993  drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade. Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his \"unique\" security arrangements. After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it. Like his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon. Legal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment\" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected.", "title": "Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison", "label": "fake", "id": 534}

If they fulfill their obligations to us, he added, the answer is yes. Mr. Trumps statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United States defense of its major allies. It was consistent, however, with his previous threat to withdraw American forces from Europe and Asia if those allies fail to pay more for American protection.

DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 1530 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country youve ever really known. And thats exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you whove benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families. Im sure this election has been stressful for you. It cant be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nations problems. Thats not fair, its not kind, and its also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger. Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. Youve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldnt be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are. I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential  thats what makes our country great, and thats the promise Im going to fight to fulfill. So heres my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope youll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country  and thats what DACA can provide. But I know thats not enough  we have to do more for you and your families. Thats why as president, Im going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office. While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, Ill do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Courts deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the presidents authority and wont stop fighting until we see it through. So today, lets celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people its helped so far  and lets also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours. We have always been a nation of immigrants  those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I wont forget it, and I wont forget you.

{"message": "A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming. The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing. \"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago,\" the narrator says. The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam. \"Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment.\" With images such as a newspaper headline that says \"McCain climate views clash with GOP,\" the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change. Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. When he introduced the bill, McCain called it \"the first comprehensive piece of legislation\" in capping emissions. \"The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions,\" he said. \"It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem.\" By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in \"educating the Senate\" about how government could respond to global warming. \"It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House,\" Roy said. He called McCain \"a huge leader on this issue in the Senate.\" And so we find McCain's statement to be True.", "title": "McCain spoke up early", "label": "real", "id": 538}

The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated  forced  them to get health care.\" Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common. One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate. That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance. Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like. Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University. Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all the reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't. Obama's argument is that if you then fine them, you're essentially punishing the poor  and they will still be uninsured. Obama is betting that his plan will get costs low enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later. So is it fair for Obama to call his plan \"universal\"? Well, not really.

{"message": "The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella. Thats how onerous and confounding the nations tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for \"meaningful tax reform\" and blasting the complexity of the tax code. \"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news,\" Lance said in the news release. But not all the news is bad for Lance. Lets first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible. A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Services Taxpayers Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Words word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at about 4 million. We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business. So Lances claim about the number of words is generally accurate. Next, lets look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lances chief of staff. Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publishers version of the tax code is 5,036 pages. \"Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then youre looking at one private publishers version of the code,\" he said. \"We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it.\" The key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible. Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair. \"The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,\" Olson said in an e-mail. Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said theres no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words. Mardaga also noted that dividing 4 million  the number of words in the tax code  by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not Lances seven. We looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle. \"It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you,\" he said. \"Im not sure theres a right or wrong answer to the question.\" Our ruling Lance said, \"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news.\" Its generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the codes length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isnt seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get Lances overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True.

{"message": "On Sunday, former President Bill Clinton  whose wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, is battling for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination  fielded some tough questions from four college journalists during mtvU's \"Editorial Board\" in New Orleans. The Clinton installment of \"Editorial Board\" premieres March 26 on mtvU. While the questions were largely expected, Clinton's answers were not. The event  the first in a televised series that will give selected writers and editors from mtvU's College Media Network the opportunity to meet with some of today's most prominent political figures  provided Clinton an opportunity to set the record straight. When asked about those remarks he'd made leading up to the South Carolina primary (he pointedly compared Senator Barack Obama's candidacy to that of Jesse Jackson's in '84 and '88, which some perceived as his attempt to pigeonhole his wife's rival as the \"black\" candidate), Clinton said his remarks were blown out of proportion by a media hungry for controversy during election season. \"Contrary to the myth, I went through South Carolina and never said a bad word about Senator Obama  not one,\" he insisted. \"I went to African-American college campuses and said, 'Look, I expect most of you are going to vote against Hillary. But I want you to know that she wants your vote.' That's what we did. You can't blame the African-American community for being proud of having a candidate who's immensely impressive, who has had a lot of support in the North among non-African-Americans and has generated all this excitement among young people. I don't think it's rocket science. The fact that people are excited about Senator Obama's candidacy in the African-American community is entirely understandable.\" But Clinton warned against approaching this election as though it were a popularity contest. He said while thousands of Americans have rallied around Obama's call for change, his wife has been making change for years. \"It is almost impossible to find any Democrat who has accomplished more in less time in the Senate  and with Republicans  on both domestic and foreign-policy issues and military issues\" than Hillary Clinton, he said. Bill Clinton also said that Obama has been running a campaign that suggests, \"If you were part of making good things happen in the '90s and stopping bad things from happening in this decade ... then you are part of a culture of conflict and you are so yesterday. The only way we can have a good president is to make a completely new beginning. \"This is the first election in history that I can remember where experience  and having, actually, experience as a change-maker  should be a disability for being elected,\" he added. \"All of you who are young have a right to say that, but don't pretend you're not saying that.\" Later, Clinton took exception to suggestions that Obama has rejected special-interest funds in his campaign. \"[Obama] was the only one who kept his [political action committee],\" Clinton said. \"Then, in the beginning, he spends 40 percent of the PAC money  43 percent, to be exact  on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina politicians. Those states constitute 3.7 percent of America's population. He also admitted that his political action committee consulted with his campaign on how to spread the money out. So, therefore, it is not true that he has run a campaign without any special-interest money influencing the presidential campaign.\" When asked why African-Americans' support of his wife continues to drop, Clinton pointed to Obama's caucus win in Iowa as the turning point  not the comments he made before South Carolina's primary. \"The minute it became possible that [Obama] could be the nominee, he was going to win the lion's share of the African-American vote,\" Clinton surmised. \"And I think that I never begrudged it.\" The issue of drug use was also broached. Clinton famously remarked in the '90s that he had experimented with marijuana but \"never inhaled,\" and Obama has also admitted to trying cocaine as a youth. Clinton was asked whether voters might be swayed by such things from a candidate's past. \"It was also an issue when President Bush ran for the first time, because he didn't answer the cocaine question, right? ... I think the voters rendered a verdict ... that what you did when you were really young is not going to bar you from serving as president,\" he said. Clinton later told the crowd assembled for Sunday's event that he thinks Congress may abolish the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy regarding gays serving in the military before year's end. \"It would have been a better policy if it had been implemented the way General [Colin] Powell and I agreed to implement it. ... I think we may have the support now in Congress to get rid of it altogether,\" Clinton said. \"That's what we should do. We should do what every other major country has done and allow gays to serve honorably in the military. ... Our guys came to us and said, 'Look. If you don't agree to this, they're going to bury you. You will have nothing.' \" Get informed!

{"message": "What this plan will do is to make the insurance you have work better for you. Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. As soon as I sign this bill, it will be against the law for insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick or water it down when you need it most. They will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime. We will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they get sick. And insurance companies will be required to cover, with no extra charge, routine checkups and preventive care, like mammograms and colonoscopies  because there's no reason we shouldn't be catching diseases like breast cancer and colon cancer before they get worse. That makes sense, it saves money, and it saves lives. That's what Americans who have health insurance can expect from this plan  more security and stability. Now, if you're one of the tens of millions of Americans who don't currently have health insurance, the second part of this plan will finally offer you quality, affordable choices. If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage. If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange  a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices. Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves. For those individuals and small businesses who still cannot afford the lower-priced insurance available in the exchange, we will provide tax credits, the size of which will be based on your need. And all insurance companies that want access to this new marketplace will have to abide by the consumer protections I already mentioned. This exchange will take effect in four years, which will give us time to do it right. In the meantime, for those Americans who can't get insurance today because they have pre-existing medical conditions, we will immediately offer low-cost coverage that will protect you against financial ruin if you become seriously ill. This was a good idea when Senator John McCain proposed it in the campaign, it's a good idea now, and we should embrace it. Now, even if we provide these affordable options, there may be those  particularly the young and healthy  who still want to take the risk and go without coverage. There may still be companies that refuse to do right by their workers. The problem is, such irresponsible behavior costs all the rest of us money. If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance, it means we pay for those people's expensive emergency room visits. If some businesses don't provide workers health care, it forces the rest of us to pick up the tab when their workers get sick, and gives those businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. And unless everybody does their part, many of the insurance reforms we seek  especially requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions  just can't be achieved.", "title": "Obamas Health Care Speech to Congress", "label": "real", "id": 543}
{"message": "The president's plan for the economy: Will it work? We'll hear from both sides  the Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers Dr. Christina Romer and the House Republican Whip Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) join us for exclusive interviews. Plus, an economic and political roundtable with The Week's David Frum, BBC's Katty Kay, CNBC's Steve Liesman, and PBS's Tavis Smiley. MR. DAVID GREGORY: Our issues this Sunday: Mixed signals for the economy. Stocks rally but wealth sharply declines, jobless claims reach another high, home foreclosures jump 30 percent in February. Despite that, the White House is determined to sound optimistic. (Videotape) PRES. BARACK OBAMA: If we are keeping focused on all the fundamentally sound aspects of our economy, then we're going to get through this. And I'm very confident about that. (End videotape) MR. GREGORY: But is the White House doing enough to win what has been called an economic war? We'll hear from both sides of the debate. Chair of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer; and the man charged with mobilizing his party's votes in the House, Republican Whip Eric Cantor. Then, halfway through his first 100 days in office, has the president's economic team lived up to expectations? Has the White House tried to take on too many problems at once? And on the Republican side of the aisle, more controversy over comments from the newly installed RNC chairman, Michael Steele. Our economic and political roundtable weighs in: columnist for The Week and a speechwriter for President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002, David Frum; Washington correspondent for BBC World News America, Katty Kay; senior economics reporter for CNBC, Steve Liesman; and host of PBS' \"Tavis Smiley\" and author of the new book \"Accountable: Making America as Good as Its Promise,\" Tavis Smiley. But first, Dr. Christina Romer, welcome to MEET THE PRESS. DR. CHRISTINA ROMER: Great to be here. MR. GREGORY: Nice, nice to have you here. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett described the economy and the crisis that the economy is in as an economic war. If that's the case, are we winning? DR. ROMER: I think he's absolutely right, it is an economic war. We have inherited a crisis like none since we've--since we had the Great Depression. So absolutely, it is something we need to deal with. I think we are. We haven't won yet. We have staged a wonderful battle. So we have put in place just a host of programs: the stimulus package, the financial rescue plan, the housing plan. We think it's the right medicine and we think it will work. MR. GREGORY: There's an effort across the administration to sound more confident about the economy. The president, speaking on Friday, said this: (Videotape, Friday) PRES. OBAMA: If we are keeping focused on all the fundamentally sound aspects of our economy, then we're going to get through this. And I'm very confident about that. (End videotape) MR. GREGORY: And yet last year during the campaign, Senator John McCain said something similar. This is what he said back then. (Videotape, September 15, 2008) SEN. JOHN McCAIN (R-AZ): You know that there's been tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street, and it is--it's--people are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think--still, the fundamentals our--of our economy are strong, but these are very, very difficult time. (End videotape) MR. GREGORY: So back then during the campaign when Senator McCain talked about the strong fundamentals of the economy, it was then-candidate Obama and his team that roundly criticized McCain, saying he was out of touch, he didn't get it, he didn't understand how bad the economy was. And yet now the president's talking about the strong fundamentals of the economy. So what's different between then, the campaign, and now, except for the fact that the economy's gotten dramatically worse? DR. ROMER: I think when the president says he's focusing on fundamentals, what he means is, is we're focusing on, on fixing the fundamentals; that we've always said we're not looking at the ups and downs of the stock market, we're looking for those crucial indicators: when are jobs turning around, when are sales turning around, when do we see consumers coming to life? That's the kind of thing that--certainly that I'm looking at in terms of when's the economy going to be doing better and, and when can we see some hope. MR. GREGORY: Are the fundamentals of this economy sound? DR. ROMER: Well, of course the fundamentals are sound in the sense that the American workers are sound, we have a good capital stock, we have good technology. We know that, that temporarily we're in a mess, right? We've seen huge job loss, we've seen very large falls in GDP. So certainly in the short run we're in a, in a bad situation. MR. GREGORY: All right, but then what's different between now and then, when the economy was in even better shape than it, it is now, when McCain was saying the fundamentals were strong and then-candidate Obama criticized him? DR. ROMER: I think--again, I think what, what we're saying is that the, you know, where we are today is obviously not good. We have a plan in place to get to a good place. I think that's the crucial--a fundamentally crucial difference, is to make sure that you have put in place all of the comprehensive programs that'll get us back to those fundamentals. The other thing I think is so important, the president has actually said in terms of fundamentals, we need to make changes. That's why he's focusing on energy, education, getting the budget deficit under control, precisely because he said... MR. GREGORY: Right. DR. ROMER: ...when we get through this thing, we want to be in a better place. MR. GREGORY: But perhaps Senator McCain was right when he said the fundamentals of the economy were strong, because you have President Obama saying roughly the same thing now? DR. ROMER: I really think you're misinterpreting the president. I think the key thing that the president was saying is we have our eyes on the fundamentals, that is why we're concerned about. MR. GREGORY: Hm. DR. ROMER: And he was--I think very much has been drawing this distinction between the day-to-day ups and downs in the stock market, because that, we know, is a, a bad way to gauge policy. MR. GREGORY: I want to talk about projections for the economy, where you see it going. You were asked on March 6th that very question, and this is how you responded. (Videotape, March 6, 2009) DR. ROMER: Most people are predicting some time in the second half of the year, and, and I expect that's when we'll start to see positive GDP growth again. And a little after that we'll start to see employment going up rather than going down. (End videotape) MR. GREGORY: Pretty strong prediction. What if you're wrong? What's plan B? DR. ROMER: Well, so one thing--I mean, I should say my prediction is very much what most private forecasters are saying. We know that this last week the blue chip economic indicators came out that surveys lots of private forecasters. Almost all of them are predicting a turnaround in the third quarter and, and positive growth in the fourth quarter. Obviously I'm not a fortune teller and, you know, we're going to be watching this thing like a hawk. We've--we think we've put in place the right programs that will bring this kind of a change about, but the president has always said we'll do whatever it takes if it doesn't work. MR. GREGORY: Well, would you disagree with the notion that government has fundamentally underestimated the scale of this problem going back to the previous administration? DR. ROMER: I think, I think everybody underestimated the scale of this problem. I think inherently it, it surprised us. MR. GREGORY: Right. DR. ROMER: That's why... MR. GREGORY: So if that's the case, there's pretty high probability that even your own prediction will fall short. Which leads to the question then, what's plan B? Don't Americans deserve to know what the administration is thinking about doing if those projects don't, don't bear out? DR. ROMER: Well, there are a couple of things. One is that as--you know, as this has gone on, we're getting lots more information. So the chances that we're going to be surprised, I think, are going down. You know, I think the, the crucial thing, you know, we have put in place what is, is just simply the biggest, boldest recovery package in history, right; the stimulus package, biggest ever; the financial rescue, absolutely comprehensive; a housing plan--that is incredible medicine for the economy. And we fully expect it to work. That's why we put those, those policies in place. MR. GREGORY: Do, do you see a need, though, as Speaker Pelosi indicated this week, the potential for additional stimulus, for a second stimulus package? DR. ROMER: I think it, I think it's premature to be talking about that just simply because this one's just barely, barely been passed. I think it was passed three weeks ago. We've had the first checks go out to the state. We know people won't see any change in their withholding until April 1st. So we certainly have to give this one a chance to work before we start talking about anything else.", "title": "Meet the Press, online at MSNBC- msnbc.com", "label": "real", "id": 544}
{"message": "On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others. \"There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe,\" Hannity said. \"Now, this is a terrorist act,\" Hannity said. \"What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?\" \"Here's the point,\" Hannity said, \"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can.\" We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the \"global war on terrorism\" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out. We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase \"war on terrorism\" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase \"war on terror,\" but only a couple of times. So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question. The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase \"war on terror\" and \"frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.\" Obama: \"I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. \"And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down. \"But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.\" The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: Cooper: \"I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?\" Obama: \"Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.\" Cooper: \"So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?\" Obama: \"You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.\" So Obama isn't fond of the phrase \"war on terror.\" But did that ever become blanket White House policy? According to a Washington Post story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said \"this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or \"Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' \" According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials. Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of \"a career civil servant.\" Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term \"war on terror,\" or the like, very often. Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words \"terror\" or \"terrorism\" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world. The absence of those words \"goes to the heart\" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009. \"As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaidas murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat.\" Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. \"President Obama has articulated a clear policy  to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies,\" Brennan said. \"That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver.\" Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the \"war on terror.\" Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term \"war on terrorism.\" And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase \"war on terror,\" Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase \"war on terrorism.\" And so we rate Hannity's statement True.", "title": "Hannity says Obama won't even use the term \"war on terrorism\"", "label": "real", "id": 545}

Immediately thereafter, as always happens when Democrats take a stand, the civility police came out in force. The president, we were told, was being too partisan; he needs to treat his opponents with respect; he should have lunch with them, and work out a consensus. Thats a bad idea. Equally important, its an undemocratic idea. Lets review the story so far. Two weeks ago, House Republicans released their big budget proposal, selling it to credulous pundits as a statement of necessity, not ideology  a document telling America What Must Be Done. But it was, in fact, a deeply partisan document, which you might have guessed from the opening sentence: Where the president has failed, House Republicans will lead. It hyped the danger of deficits, yet even on its own (not at all credible) accounting, spending cuts were used mainly to pay for tax cuts rather than deficit reduction. The transparent and obvious goal was to use deficit fears to impose a vision of small government and low taxes, especially on the wealthy. So the House budget proposal revealed a yawning gap between the two parties priorities. And it revealed a deep difference in views about how the world works.", "title": "Lets Not Be Civil - The New York Times", "label": "real", "id": 547}

{"message": "April 25, 2010  -- TAPPER: Good morning, everyone. Tomorrow, the Senate is scheduled to hold its first vote on the biggest overhaul in decades of the nation's financial system, changes that could impact your savings, your pension, maybe even your job. This as a big Wall Street investment bank comes under attack on Tuesday. Executives from Goldman Sachs, which is already facing government accusations of fraud, will testify before a Senate committee investigating whether the firm profited from the massive housing crash at the expense of its clients. Joining me this morning, three key players in the middle of this storm. With me here, is Austan Goolsbee from the President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Chattanooga, we have Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, and in Cincinnati, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, both key members of the Senate Banking Committee. Gentlemen, welcome. GOOLSBEE: Thanks for having us. CORKER: Good morning. Good to be with you. TAPPER: Before we start with Wall Street reform, I do want to talk about these Goldman Sachs memos, these emails that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has released, emails that seem to show executives rejoicing as the housing market crashed, and in fact, they seem to contradict the impression given by Goldman Sachs that they lost money as the mortgage related investment crash happened. In a private email, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein wrote in November of 2007, \"Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.\" Senator Brown, I want to ask you. What do these emails signify to you? BROWN: Well, these emails signify that there are all kinds of conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that there are -- that Wall Street, while working for its clients and working against its clients in the same sort of bundled toxic securities, and that's why we need the Volcker rule. That's why we need really strong reform that will separate the proprietary trading from banking functions. I think that says it more articulately and more forcefully, that example, than anything we've seen so far. TAPPER: Senator Corker, doesn't Senator Brown have a point? This is exactly why people think that proprietary trading, that is when a bank uses its own money to invest, should not be the same, it should not be in the same firm as trading for commercial banking, for clients? That there is an inbred conflict of interest there. CORKER: Well, I can understand the sentiment. I know that certainly the emails do not read well. I look forward to seeing what the SEC investigation brings forth, and the Senate investigation through this subcommittee brings forth. At the end of the day, though, some of that has to do with making markets. I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed in the emails, but I think we're better off waiting to see exactly what has taken place. I think, you know, at the end of the day, instruments are set up on Wall Street. People take either side of it. There are some conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked at, but I'd rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds before making any judgments. TAPPER: Austan, is there anything in the legislation that Democrats are pushing that President Obama wants to pass, is there anything that would have prevented what Goldman Sachs is accused of having committed? GOOLSBEE: You know, I don't know the exact details, but there are a number of things that would go directly at the heart of some of these issues that are raised in these cases, like with securitizations, that the people who originate the securities have to maintain some ownership so that if they pack it full of things that are going to fail, they themselves are going to lose money when they do it. I'm certainly not going to comment on independent, you know, regulatory investigations, but these emails that are released, the CEO of Goldman is not going to win any popularity contests when over a period that ordinary Americans' pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were actually making significant money off of it. If that's true, I think Senator Brown's point, that we've got to end the conflicts of interest and that the Volcker rule is really on point on that I think is also highly relevant. TAPPER: Senator Corker, the status of the Wall Street reform bill. Right now, the members of the Senate Banking Committee are negotiating. Tomorrow, the majority leader, Harry Reid, is scheduled to bring it up for a vote. Do you think there will be a bipartisan compromise before that vote happens, and if not, are all 41 Republicans going to stand against proceeding to a debate? CORKER: Look, first of all, I think everybody knows, Sherrod sure knows I want to see a bill. I think we do need to address regulation in our financial markets. You know, it's in play right now. The fact is, I know that Shelby and Dodd are actually on another program this morning. After that program, I know they're going to continue meeting, hopefully getting to a compromise before tomorrow evening. And I think what we need to do is have a template. We don't need to address every issue in this compromise, but one that deals with derivatives, one that deals with consumer protection, and one that deals with this orderly liquidation. If we can get that template agreed to in a bipartisan way, then we can debate some of the amendments that Sherrod Brown wants to bring forth, some of the amendments I want to bring forth. But I think it's very, very important that we reach that bipartisan agreement first, because in the Senate, as you know, it takes 60 votes to change anything.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Goolsbee, Brown  and  Corker", "label": "real", "id": 549}

Under current law, those who have access to the privileged \"non-public information\" gathered through official oversight proceedings may be using that information for personal benefit in securities and commodities trading. Equally as abhorrent, lobbyists and traders who haunt the halls of Congress seeking insider tips from staff  known as political intelligence consultants  may also enrich themselves and their clients off of this confidential information. This type of \"insider trading\" would be illegal for you and me - so why should it be legal for government officials? Congress should be watch dogging Wall Street - not gold digging for insider profits. This loophole must be closed. Urge Congress to pass the \"Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act\"! Introduced by Reps. Brian Baird (D-Wash.), Louise McIntosh Slaughter (D-NY) and Tim Walz (D-Minn.), the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (H.R. 682) would ensure that the same insider trading restrictions we face apply to Congress members and staff as well as the federal government.", "title": "Public Citizen", "label": "real", "id": 550}

{"message": "House GOP Introduces Keep Terrorists Out of America Act Washington, May 7 - House Republicans today introduced the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act, legislation aimed at stopping the transfer or release of terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. The legislation unequivocally opposes releasing terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay facility and transferring them to the United States, makes clear that governors and state legislatures must pre-approve the transfer or release of any terrorist detainee into their respective states, and requires the Administration to meet strict criteria and certification standards before terrorists housed at the Guantanamo prison could be brought to the United States. Republican Leader John Boehner (R-OH) issued the following statement on the legislation: This bill has a straightforward but vital purpose: to ensure that the terrorists held in the Guantanamo Bay prison are not imported into the United States. We are giving every member of Congress an opportunity to stand with the American people by affirming their opposition to bringing these terrorists into our communities, and we hope they join us. Equally as important, this bill holds the Administration accountable if it acts unilaterally against the will of the American people. The world did not suddenly become safe in January 2009. There are still terrorists around the world who are committed to killing Americans and destroying our way of life. A number of those terrorists are being held at the prison in Guantanamo Bay right now. If the Administration is allowed to proceed, they wont be there for long. In fact, they may be right here, in the United States. I have been urging the Administration to finally present to the American people its plan for what to do with the terrorists held at Guantanamo and for confronting and defeating the global terrorist threat. Right now, that plan does not exist, and the safety of our nation depends on it. Our ranking members John McHugh, Pete Hoekstra, Lamar Smith, Peter King, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen all deserve great credit for their work on this measure. I thank them for their efforts in crafting this critically important bill. NOTE: Following is a summary of the Keep Terrorists Out of America Act: Affirming Congress Opposition to the Release and Transfer of Terrorists. The bill affirms Congress opposition to transferring or releasing terrorists held at the Guantanamo Bay prison into the United States. Most Americans do not support releasing these terrorists from Guantanamo Bay prison and transferring them into the United States. The bill gives Congress an opportunity to show that it stands with the American people on this critical matter, and opposes the release and transfer of these terrorists. Governor  and  State Legislature Pre-Approval. The measure prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without express approval from the states governor and legislature, and certifies to Congress that strict requirements have been met. For example, the Administration must certify to the respective governor and state legislature that the detainee does not pose a security risk to the United States. The certifications must be made 60 days before any transfer or release. Presidential Certification Requirements. The measure prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides the following notification and certification to Congress regarding: - The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States. - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee. - The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee. - The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States. #####", "title": "House GOP Introduces Keep Terrorists Out of America Act", "label": "real", "id": 553}
{"message": "July 25, 2010  -- TAPPER: Secretary Geithner thanks for joining us. Good to see you. So, the administration has had a number of successes after big battles, stimulus, health care legislation, new rules for Wall Street, but you have a big battle coming when it comes to the Bush tax cuts. If they remain in place, as Republicans want, it will cost three trillion dollars every ten years. The administration has said it wants to keep the ones for people who make under $200,000 a year, individuals and $250,000 for couples. That will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Ben Bernanke the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that with the economic outlook unusually uncertain, extending the Bush tax cuts would have a stimulative effect on the economy. Is he right? GEITHNER: I don't think it should be a battle, Jake. You know, what the President's proposing to do is to leave in place, to extend tax cuts that go to more than 95 percent of working Americans and to leave in place tax cuts that are very important to incent businesses to hire new pe -- new employees and to invest in expanding output. We think that's a -- the -- it's a very strong package. We think it's the right package. We think it's fair. We think it's responsible. Now, we also think it's responsible to let the tax cuts expire that just go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans. We think that's the responsible thing to do because we need to make sure we can show the world that they're willing as a country now to start to make some progress bringing down our long -- our long-term deficits. TAPPER: Don't you think it will slow economic growth? GEITHNER: No. Just letting those tax cuts that only go to 2 percent to 3 percent of Americans, the highest earning Americans in the country expire. I do not believe it will have a negative effect on growth. TAPPER: This package that you're talking about pushing in Congress to -- to save the Bush tax cuts for people under $200,000 individuals and 250 for couples -- GEITHNER: And in fact, we go beyond that. Because you know, we're proposing to extend the make or pay tax cut which also goes to 95 percent of working Americans. And a set of very important business tax cuts targeted for small businesses themselves, expensing, zero capital gains rate for investment in small businesses. These things, we think, are very helpful, very powerful. TAPPER: And when are you talking about pushing that into Congress? GEITHNER: Congress is on the verge of what we hope will be enactment of a very strong package of tax measures for small businesses and ways to help them get credit so they can expand. TAPPER: So, before the election? GEITHNER: Oh, absolutely. TAPPER: A number of Senate democrats, moderate Senate democrats have said that they oppose repealing or allowing to expire the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans that they think that would be harmful to growth. Are you guys going to have the votes to get through the package you want which is focused more on middle and lower income America? GEITHNER: Oh absolutely. I believe we will. TAPPER: Some in the administration and internal discussions are talking about maybe just keeping all the Bush tax cuts for a year or two. Those aren't -- that's not going to happen? GEITHNER: I don't believe it should and I don't believe it will. Again, because what the president's proposed is to make sure we're leaving them in place for the people that need the most and can make the most difference in helping make sure this economy comes back. That we heal the damage caused by this crisis. TAPPER: Job creation has not gone as well as you hoped. What more can you do? I know there's this small business lending initiative. What more can you do given the lack of appetite on Capitol Hill for any spending programs? Any more stimulus? GEITHNER: Well you know, the President's proposed a very strong package of help for small businesses which you just referred to. He'd support giving more support to states so they can keep teachers in the classroom. TAPPER: Fifty billion dollars in emergency spending but the Congress has not acted on that. GEITHNER: They haven't yet, but we can (inaudible) case for doing it. They're going to, we're going to keep at that. But right now, the best thing the government can do in addition to those things, is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good. TAPPER: By the private sector. GEITHNER: Pretty good this early in a recession. TAPPER: Although you count in the public sector with the layoffs and the census jobs. GEITHNER: But only because of census. But you know, what matters is -- is the private sector starting to hire people, add back hours and that's what's critical. And you're seeing that happen now. Now we want it -- we want to see it happen at a faster pace. But I think most people understand that you know, this was a deep crisis. The scars ran very deep. Devastating damage. It's going to take time to repair that damage, take time to grow out of this. But we're making progress. TAPPER: In 2009 when President Obama talked about unemployment insurance extensions he talked about how it was paid for. This time, it was not paid for, the $34 billion in unemployment insurance extensions became added to the national debt. Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that they wanted to pay for it and they supported it but they just wanted it offset by spending cuts. Given the fact that we're going to be -- we're going to have unemployment for the foreseeable future, high unemployment. Isn't it the fiscally responsible thing to do to not treat this as emergency spending but treat this as something we know is coming down the pike so we're not just laying this burden on our future generations? GEITHNER: I don't think so. In a crisis that was this bad and a recession that was that deep. With this amount of lasting damage, scars from recovery, it's appropriate to treat these things as emergencies.", "title": "'This Week' Transcript: Geithner", "label": "real", "id": 554}

{"message": "Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion  a staggering $227.4 million on average  but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent. The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest. (I can relate to that.) I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people. They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them. Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldnt mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering. Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our countrys finances. Theyve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. Its vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our countrys fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality. Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America cant fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax.

{"message": "Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press. \"He talks tough on some of these issues,\" Rubio said Dec. 13. \"For example, he was going to carpet bomb ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\" Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending. We decided to fact-check Rubios claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president. Cruzs vote on Rand Pauls budget proposal Rubios campaign pointed to Cruzs 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Pauls amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed. Pauls 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade. Rubios campaign pointed to Pauls statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending: \"This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,\" Paul wrote. \"It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.\" Under Pauls proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels. Was Pauls proposal a cut for defense? So why did Rubio refer to Pauls budget as a \"cut\" if defense spending would rise? \"We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,\" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said. But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Pauls proposal a \"cut.\" \"Pauls defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the presidents budget was an even larger increase),\" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"But Pauls defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.\" Pauls 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obamas request both at the time and now, Harrison said. Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Pauls budget a \"cut.\" \"As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,\" he said. \"This is misleading.\" Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument. \"So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a cut when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,\" Phillips said. \"The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.\" Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruzs vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Pauls amendment which would have boosted it with offsets. \"This was a budget, so it doesnt make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,\" Friedman said. Our ruling Rubio said that the only budget Cruz \"ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.\" Rubio was referring to Cruzs vote in favor of Pauls budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Pauls plan when he called it a \"cut.\" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth. However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Pauls proposal for defense was below Obamas request.

You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really unfair.\" The politics of immigration is different in New York. Immigration and burden are two words that do not appear often -- or without raising a furor -- in the same sentence. Whatever their legal status, immigrants are considered a fact of life, a point of pride and an integral part of New York City's identity. Many New Yorkers know well that their own forebears arrived without papers. \"So many of the Irish, so many of the Italians who came when my parents came, were technically illegal,\" Mr. Cuomo said. Because of New York City's size, new immigrants are absorbed without as much fuss as elsewhere. Often, they are responsible for revitalizing dying neighborhoods -- like Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Flushing, Queens -- and New Yorkers know it. Illegal immigrants in New York City confound the national stereotype of a young Mexican man sneaking across the border. Italians are the largest group, followed by Ecuadoreans, Poles, Dominicans and Trinidadians. European, Caribbean, Latin American and Asian, they blend into the city without radically altering its racial and ethnic makeup.

And Clinton offered advice and thoughts on some of Obama's next issues -- a Supreme Court nomination, the Middle East peace process and the midterm elections. Anchor Jake Tapper asked Clinton about Limbaugh's criticism of his speech marking the upcoming 15th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. In that speech, Clinton warned that \"the words we use really do matter, because there's this vast echo chamber, and they go across space and they fall on the serious and delirious alike. They fall on the connected and the unhinged alike.\" On \"This Week,\" Clinton said, \"The only point I tried to make was that we ought to have a lot of political dissent -- a lot of political argument. Nobody is right all the time. But we also have to take responsibility for the possible consequences of what we say.\" Clinton said he worries about threats against President Obama and the Congress. And, he worries \"about more careless language ... some of which we've seen against the Republican governor in New Jersey, Gov. Christie.\" A recently leaked memo from a New Jersey teacher joked about Christie dying. \"I think we all have to be careful,\" Clinton said. \"We ought to remember [that] after Oklahoma City we learned something about the difference in disagreement and demonization.\" Clinton acknowledged that he was wrong to take what he now views as bad advice from his Treasury secretaries, Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, who told him the market for complex financial instruments known as derivatives ought to remain unregulated. \"On derivatives, yeah, I think they were wrong and I think I was wrong to take [their advice],\" Clinton said, \"because the argument on derivatives was that these things are expensive and sophisticated and only a handful of investors will buy them, and they don't need any extra protection and any extra transparency. The money they're putting up guarantees them transparency. \"The flaw in that argument,\" Clinton added, \"was that first of all sometimes people with a lot of money make stupid decisions and make it without transparency.\" The former president said he also was wrong in his understanding of what a collapse in the derivative market could do to the economy. \"The most important flaw,\" he said, \"was even if less than 1 percent of the total investment community is involved in derivative exchanges, so much money was involved that if they went bad, they could affect 100 percent of the investments, and indeed 100 percent of the citizens in countries, not investors. And I was wrong about that.\" He now wishes he had tried to regulate derivatives while in office, but he doesn't think he would have been successful. \"Now, I think if I had tried to regulate them, because the Republicans were the majority in the Congress, they would have stopped it,\" he said. \"But I wish I should have been caught trying. I mean, that was a mistake I made.\"", "title": "Bill Clinton on Rush Limbaugh, His Own Mistakes, the Supreme Court, Middle East Peace", "label": "real", "id": 561}
{"message": "Payday Lending Programs Revised Examination Guidance The FDIC is issuing the attached revised examination guidance on payday lending programs. The revisions provide more specific guidance to FDIC-supervised institutions to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs. There is currently a small number of FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is issuing the attached revised examination guidance on payday lending programs. The revisions provide more specific guidance with respect to the appropriate limits on payday loan use to ensure that this high-cost, short-term credit product is not provided repeatedly to customers with longer-term credit needs. Payday loans are small-dollar, unsecured, short-term advances that have high fees relative to the size of the loan. When used frequently or for long periods, the total costs can rapidly exceed the amount borrowed. The FDIC initially issued guidance on payday lending in July 2003 because payday lending is a high-risk activity that presents significant safety and soundness and consumer protection concerns. The FDIC's concerns about payday lending have been heightened as it has observed payday lending conducted in a manner that is inconsistent with the July 2003 guidance and inconsistent with prudent lending practices. The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer. To reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous 12- month period. When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past 12 months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs. In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances. Other key provisions of the July 2003 guidance remain unchanged. FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance. In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending.", "title": "FDIC: FIL-14-2005: Revised Examination Guidance", "label": "real", "id": 562}
{"message": "We can all agree that if we want to bring down skyrocketing costs, we'll need to modernize our system and invest in prevention. We can agree that if we want greater accountability and responsibility, we have to ensure that people aren't overcharged for prescription drugs, or discriminated against for pre-existing conditions -- and we need to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse in government programs. I think most of us would agree that if we want to cover all Americans, we can't make the mistake of trying to fix what isn't broken. So if somebody has insurance they like, they should be able to keep that insurance. If they have a doctor that they like, they should be able to keep their doctor. They should just pay less for the care that they receive. And finally, we can all agree that if we want to translate these goals into policies, we need a process that is as transparent and inclusive as possible. And that's why I've asked all of you -- representatives of organizations, interests, and parties from across the spectrum -- to join us here today. In fact, this was the hottest ticket in town. (Laughter.) That's why we asked concerned citizens like the folks on this stage to organize open meetings across America where people could air their views. As Travis said, more than 3,000 meetings were held in all 50 states and D.C.; more than 30,000 people attended. I thank them for their input and their ideas, and look forward to reading the report that Travis has presented to me. In this effort, every voice has to be heard. Every idea must be considered. Every option must be on the table. There should be no sacred cows. Each of us must accept that none of us will get everything that we want, and that no proposal for reform will be perfect. If that's the measure, we will never get anything done. But when it comes to addressing our health care challenge, we can no longer let the perfect be the enemy of the essential. And I don't think anybody would argue that we are on a sustainable path when it comes to health care. Finally, I want to be very clear at the outset that while everyone has a right to take part in this discussion, nobody has the right to take it over and dominate. The status quo is the one option that's not on the table, and those who seek to block any reform at all -- any reform at any costs will not prevail this time around. I didn't come here to Washington to work for those interests. I came here to work for the American people -- the folks I met on the campaign trail, the people I hear from every single day in the White House. Folks who are working hard, making all the right decisions, but still face choices that no one in this country should have to make: how long to put off that doctor's appointment; whether to fill that prescription; when to give up and head to the emergency room because there are no other options.", "title": "Obamas Remarks at the White House Health Care Forum", "label": "real", "id": 563}
{"message": "Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says President Obama has not been aggressive enough in taking the fight to ISIS militants who have ravaged Iraq and Syria The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success. \"We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,\" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.\" He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission. But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences. During the Iraq War, Schiff said, \"We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military. \"Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,\" he said. He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could \"aggravate\" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight. McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded. \"George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,\" he said. For now, Schiff said there is an \"ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS.\" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region. \"I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,\" he said.", "title": "Should ISIS' gains lead to more U.S. troops in Iraq?", "label": "real", "id": 564}

{"message": "Dear Patriot, Greetings to our constituents, fellow Floridians, and indeed all Americans, it is time to prepare our weekly update for dissemination. Today is the 71st Anniversary of the attack on US Naval Base, Pearl Harbor which truly marked our entry into World War II. I can still remember my dad sharing with me his feeling when he heard about this attack on the radio. Of course, he would go forth and serve in the US Army during World War II in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). Little did my dad realize at the time, that he was beginning a legacy of service to our nation that has now spanned four generations. My dad was a member of that Greatest Generation and today his grandson, my nephew, carries that honor to this day. As with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor, America has, and always will, produce the caliber of men and women who stand as guardians for our nations honor. These are men and women who have answered the call then and continue to do so now. Tomorrow many in our nation will watch the next generation of these men and women as Americas Football Game takes place, Army vs. Navy. I wonder how many of these young men and women have relatives who were at Pearl Harbor, or served in World War II? I am proud to know that my own godson, Midshipman John Melvin Hendricks (that rascal who joined the Navy) will be taking that field tomorrow, his second year. So as we remember Pearl Harbor today, let us never forget those who will stand and answer the call to arms to protect this Republic, yesterday, today, and tomorrow. And in speaking of those who serve, I was angered by the developments this week surrounding Army Major Nidal Hasan who three years ago shot 43 soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians, killing 13. An Army appellate court decision removed the current assigned judge from the case citing that he was not impartial. Furthermore, the court backed the assertion that Major Hasan did not have to be forced to shave his beard. It just appears again that we are placating and playing the game of political correctness. It is horrific enough that we have classified this terrorist attack as work place violence but consider the continued disappointment of those who lost loved ones on that day for them, it will always be a day which shall live in infamy. This week we voted in the House of Representatives to remove the word lunatic from federal law. However, that does not mean there isn't plenty of lunacy going on in the workings of the federal government! Further, I find it interesting when media pundits and talking heads ask the disturbing question, What will America do if Bashar al-Asad uses chemical weapons in his people? I would have hoped it would never get to the point of his feeling empowered to use those weapons. It just seems we continue to take a defensive posture reacting to events. If we had done as military generals on the ground had suggested in Iraq and retained a viable and credible military presence in the region, we could have precluded this. Instead we now have Iran transiting across Iraq to support Asad and continuing to support terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. The Obama Administration was in such a rush to demand former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak step down. Why not the same vigor when it comes to Mohammed Morsi? I also recall the Obama Administration supporting a Marxist/Socialist President in Honduras and not supporting the movement in Iran against Mahmoud Ahmandinejad. Confusing? Just imagine what our allies are thinking. And what happened in Benghazi? America must never stop asking that question, regardless of what the mainstream media wants to hide. Losing an Ambassador, a Foreign Service officer, and two former US Navy SEALS must never EVER become the new normal. Today, we received the monthly jobs report for November, with 7.7% unemployment and 146,000 jobs created. On the surface it is good news. However, one step beyond the superficial, we realize this is still an economy limping along. First, the previous job creation numbers from the months of September and October were revised downward by 50,000 respectively. Second, the unemployment rate dropped due to another 350,000 Americans dropping out of the labor force. This means we still have a labor force participation rate hovering at 63.6%, which has and continues to be a record low. At this rate, we could theoretically achieve an unemployment rate of zero if everyone just quit working altogether. Finally, our U6 computation rate remains dangerously high, due not only to 12 million unemployed Americans, but also a little over 8 million underemployed Americans. Combined with a fragile economy where the US Federal Reserve is printing money in order to cover a monthly $40 billion mortgage debt, America is hardly out of the woods. These simple facts just reinforce the need to have sound fiscal, tax, and regulatory policy -- not politics -- that will incentivize economic growth and wealth expansion. The last thing the private sector and job creators need worry about is more confiscatory economics masquerading as viable solutions to a serious fiscal problem. Washington DC spends too much, and sending this Administration more American taxpayer dollars is not the answer. It is mathematically impossible to tax the rich enough to make a dent in our debt. We must be talking about where to reduce spending first. And why is it that only taxpayers, not the federal government, are expected to share the burden? This is my final weekly update from our Congressional office, but it is by no means my final weekly update... When one door closes, another opens and we shall continue to advocate for truth, the restoration of this Republic, and promote Constitutional conservative principles in the New Year. It has been my honor to serve as the Representative of the People of Floridas 22nd Congressional District. The fight for our Constitutional Republic has truly begun and I will be on the frontline. May everyone have a wonderful holiday season and may God bless the United States of America.

{"message": "Rockefeller: An Opportunity We Cant Pass Up Earlier this month, the president outlined a clear vision for health care reform  a plan that will put families ahead of corporate profits, reduce skyrocketing health care costs and provide a strong pathway for more Americans to access meaningful and affordable care. With Congress back in session and back to work on health care reform, we must continue to build on the presidents vision and capitalize on this profound opportunity to fix a broken system and make life better for millions of Americans. Today, it is an undeniable fact that millions of families carry the burden of failed health care policies and unmet promises. Too many feel as if they are walking a tightrope  just one serious illness threatens to throw them off balance and send them tumbling down. Real protection for the American people means health coverage must be accountable  the insurance that you buy today must be there when you need it tomorrow. Too many families who have paid their premiums faithfully every month for years expecting to be covered suddenly find themselves stuck with devastatingly high bills when they get sick; their plans dont actually provide coverage when they need it. It makes you wonder what the purpose of that health insurance is in the first place, if it offers no protection against the ruin that they hoped to avoid. As chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care, I believe we must continue to make tougher insurance regulation and greater transparency a top priority, and I will fight to protect families and businesses across the nation. The Finance Committee has laid out its framework, but at this point it simply does not go far enough to protect Americans from devastating insurance practices or outright loss of coverage. Many Americans  46 percent  get their health coverage through large employers in the self-insured market. Any new insurance market reforms, such as a prohibition on rescissions and benefit caps, should apply to this market as well. Otherwise, we will be doing very little to improve the coverage of a significant number of Americans. In West Virginia, the example of a local garment company, Corbin Limited, is a sad reminder of the self-insured markets risks. When Corbin declared bankruptcy in April 2003, 444 former employees were left with $2 million in medical bills. With a self-funded plan, Corbin was subject only to the Department of Labors inadequate regulation and had no licensing requirements or solvency standards. When the company went under, its employees had no means of appeal. Comprehensive health insurance reforms like prohibiting rescissions, eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions and protecting employees in case of bankruptcy must apply to all insurers and policies in every single market  including the self-insured. In the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, we recently heard testimony by Wendell Potter, who worked in the insurance industry for more than 20 years. He explained very clearly the tactics insurance companies use to keep policyholders in the dark. He said they deceive consumers with incomprehensible explanations of their benefits, often leading people to simply ignore them or throw them away. He also said that more and more consumers are falling victim to deceptive marketing practices  which essentially encourage them to buy policies with high costs and limited benefits. Consumers cant make real choices because the insurance industry doesnt use standard terms or definitions. And consumers cant challenge insurance companies decisions because the companies dont explain the terms of coverage in clear, understandable language. When insurance companies fail to meet their obligations to these people, it literally becomes a matter of life and death. Thats why since March, Ive been holding a series of hearings in the Commerce panel to get to the bottom of these misleading practices and demanding explanations from companies like CIGNA. And its why I wholeheartedly believe that holding insurance companies  including self-insured plans  accountable for their actions has to be at the heart of any true health care reform. Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled. Right now, the insurance industry is profit-driven when it should be patient-driven. Theyre unfairly raising prices, cutting people out of coverage for pre-existing conditions and, as one report I released through the committee revealed, systematically overcharging consumers who choose to see doctors outside of their networks. To fight back, I have introduced the Consumers Health Care Act. In addition to creating a strong public insurance option that would put competitive pressure on insurance companies and help drive down costs, my legislation also creates Americas Health Insurance Trust  created for consumers and run by consumers. The presidents speech marked the first time the public option has been clearly explained to the American people. He reopened the door to a serious discussion about a public insurance option  and the time to have that discussion is now. Our goal is comprehensive reform and that takes work, long hours, some disagreement, a lot of coming together and a deep commitment to bringing families real solutions once and for all. I share the presidents confidence and resolve that we will succeed. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) is chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health Care.", "title": "Rockefeller: An Opportunity We Cant Pass Up", "label": "real", "id": 567}

{"message": "(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters Tuesday that Republicans \"should stop crying\" about the possible use of the parliamentary procedure known as budget reconciliation to pass a health care reform bill.Reid said reconciliation had been used 21 times since 1981, mostly by Republicans when they were in control of the Senate for the passage of items like the Bush tax cuts. ( Here's a handy chart of when the procedure has been used .)Under reconciliation, Democrats would need a simple majority in the Senate to pass legislation, as opposed to the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster.\"They should stop crying about reconciliation as if it's never been done before,\" Reid said.Following Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon, Reid said \"nothing is off the table\" but that \"realistically, they should stop crying about this. It's been done 21 times before.\"\"The question is: Is reconciliation the only way we can do health-care reform?\" he said. \"The answer to that is no.

{"message": "The full text of the op-ed by President Barack Obama is printed below. The piece was published today in Newsweek. President Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX By President Obama Coaching my daughter Sashas basketball team is one of those times when I just get to be Dad. I snag rebounds, run drills, and have a little fun. More importantly, I get to watch Sasha and her teammates improve together, start thinking like a team, and develop self-confidence. Any parent knows there are few things more fulfilling than watching your child discover a passion for something. And as a parent, youll do anything to make sure he or she grows up believing she can take that ambition as far as she wants; that your child will embrace that quintessentially American idea that she can go as far as her talents will take her. But it wasnt so long ago that something like pursuing varsity sports was an unlikely dream for young women in America. Their teams often made do with second-rate facilities, hand-me-down uniforms, and next to no funding. What changed? Well, 40 years ago, committed women from around the country, driven by everyone who said they couldnt do something, worked with Congress to ban gender discrimination in our public schools. Title IX was the result of their efforts, and this week, we celebrated its 40th anniversary40 years of ensuring equal education, in and out of the classroom, regardless of gender. I was reminded of this milestone last month, when I awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt. When she started out as a basketball coach, Pat drove the team van to away games. She washed the uniforms in her own washing machine. One night she and her team even camped out in an opponents gym because they had no funding for a hotel. But she and her players kept their chins up and their heads in the game. And in 38 years at the University of Tennessee, Pat won eight national championships and tallied more than 1,000 winsthe most by any college coach, man or woman. More important, every single woman who ever played for Pat has either graduated or is on her way to a degree. Today, thanks in no small part to the confidence and determination they developed through competitive sports and the work ethic they learned with their teammates, girls who play sports are more likely to excel in school. In fact, more women as a whole now graduate from college than men. This is a great accomplishmentnot just for one sport or one college or even just for women but for America. And this is what Title IX is all about. Lets not forget, Title IX isnt just about sports. From addressing inequality in math and science education to preventing sexual assault on campus to fairly funding athletic programs, Title IX ensures equality for our young people in every aspect of their education. Its a springboard for success: its thanks in part to legislation like Title IX that more women graduate from college prepared to work in a much broader range of fields, including engineering and technology. Ive said that women will shape the destiny of this country, and I mean it. The more confident, empowered women who enter our boardrooms and courtrooms, legislatures, and hospitals, the stronger we become as a country. And that is what we are seeing today. Women are not just taking a seat at the table or sitting at the head of it, they are creating success on their own terms. The women who grew up with Title IX now pioneer scientific breakthroughs, run thriving businesses, govern states, and, yes, coach varsity teams. Because they do, todays young women grow up hearing fewer voices that tell them You cant, and more voices that tell them You can. We have come so far. But theres so much farther we can go. There are always more barriers we can break and more progress we can make. As president, Ill do my part to keep Title IX strong and vibrant, and maintain our schools as doorways of opportunity so every child has a fair shot at success. And as a dad, Ill do whatever it takes to make sure that this country remains the place where, no matter who you are or what you look like, you can make it if you try.", "title": "Op-ed by President Obama: President Obama Reflects on the Impact of Title IX", "label": "real", "id": 570}
{"message": "Pledge of Allegiance E-mail The following is the text of a chain e-mail that features Sen. John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance, and an anecdote from his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. John McCain's remarks about the Pledge of Allegiance In light of the recent appeals court ruling in California, with respect to the Pledge of Allegiance, the following recollection from Senator John McCain is very appropriate: 'The Pledge of Allegiance' - by Senator John McCain 'As you may know, I spent five and one half years as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. In the early years of our imprisonme nt, the NVA kept us in solitary confinement or two or three to a cell. In 1971 the NVA moved us from these conditions of isolation into large rooms with as many as 30 to 40 men to a room. This was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change and was a direct result of the efforts of millions of Americans on behalf of a few hundred POWs 10,000 miles from home. One of the men who moved into my room was a young man named Mike Christian. Mike came from a small town near Selma , Alabama . He didn't wear a pair of shoes until he was 13 years old. At 17, he enlisted in the US Navy. He later earned a commission by going to Officer Training School Then h e became a Naval Flight Officer and was shot down and captured in 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation of the opportunities this country and our military provide for people who want to work and want to succeed. As part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some prisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were handkerchiefs, scarves and other items of clothing. Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt. Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of t he cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance. I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event. One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it. That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could. The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room. As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to Pledge our allegiance to our flag and country. So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country.' 'I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.' PASS THIS ON... And on... And on! You can even send it back to me, I don't mind, because its worth reading again. oh.....and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge......

{"message": "August 1, 2010  -- AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me. PELOSI: My pleasure. AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan. Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal. PELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective. Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes. I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan. AMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote. PELOSI: No. AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote. PELOSI: Right. AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted? PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view. AMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side? PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people? Is it worth it? AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it? PELOSI: Yes. AMANPOUR: Is it worth it? PELOSI: That's the question. AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you. PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year. AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you? PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely. Secondly, governance and ending corruption..... AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, \"Time\" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban. You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again? PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest. When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women. And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption. So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governance AMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going to be a drawdown of forces BIDEN SOT---\"it could be as few as a couple thousand troops it could be more. but there will be a transition\" Does that square with -- with what you think, that it could just be a couple of thousand troops? PELOSI: Well, I hope it is more than that. I know it's not going to be turn out the lights and let's all go home on one day. But I do think the American people expect it to be somewhere between that and a -- a few thousand troops. AMANPOUR: Let's go to something much closer to home right now at the moment and that is the ethics conundrum with Representative Rangel. How does your affection and your respect for him as a colleague square with what's going on right now and what you said and declared, that this is going to be the -- the -- the most ethical Congress ---- that you're going to drain the swamp of any kind of wrongdoing and corruption, etc.? PELOSI: When I came in, I said we're draining the swamp. And we did. We have passed the most sweeping ethics reform in the history of the Congress. Any personal respect and affection we may have for people makes us sad about the course of events, but we have to pull the high ethical standard and none of our personalities is more important than that. AMANPOUR: Can you see Congressman Rangel ever returning as chairman of the Ways and Means or in any position of leadership in -- in the House? PELOSI: Well, the -- the Ethics Committee is working its will and AMANPOUR: No matter what happens? PELOSI: it's an elementary discussion, because what we have done is to wait and see what the Committee decides. I respect what they do. I'm totally out of the loop. It is independent. It is confidential, classified, secret, whatever. We don't know what it is. But we do respect the work that the members of the Committee do. AMANPOUR: Let me ask you about the mid-term elections. You are, by all accounts, one of the most -- if not the most -- powerful and successful speakers of -- in the history of the United States. You've passed so much legislation. The president was elected with a significant majority. You had control of both houses of Congress. And yet now, people are talking about you might lose your majority in the House. The gap seems to be growing wider between what's achieved and what's making an impact with the people. How did this happen? PELOSI: Well, that's one version of the story.

{"message": "Editor's note: This story was originally published April 22, 2007 The state has tried selling its unwanted jet online four times and failed. So last week, the Palin administration signed a contract with an Anchorage aircraft broker who thinks he can succeed where eBay couldn't The eBay thing didn't work out very well, said Dan Spencer, director of administrative services for the Department of Public Safety. He's the person charged with trying to get rid of the infamous Westwind II. The administration made a deal last week with Turbo North Aviation, promising the broker a 1.49 percent cut of the selling price. Former Gov. Frank Murkowski bought the jet, which cost the state about $2.6 million, over the protests of the Legislature and used it to fly around the state, sometimes mixing campaign errands with government business. After he defied almost everyone to acquire it, the jet became a political albatross for Murkowski. Gov. Sarah Palin beat Murkowski bad in last August's Republican primary. One of her campaign promises was to sell the plane and she's been trying to unload it for months. Robert Heckmann owns Turbo North Aviation. He said his company has sold more than 1,800 planes including two dozen or so jets in the past 27 years. Spencer said Heckmann suggested the asking price of $2,450,000, based on the current jet market. The state's definitely not going to give this plane away. If that was the case, then they would have sold it on eBay Heckmann said. He described prospective buyers a governments, corporate entities, oil companies, movie stars, well-to-do people. Meanwhile, the state is stuck making quarterly payments of about $62,000 on the Westwind II. So is the state sick of dealing with this bird? I don't know about anyone else Spencer said. You don't want to keep making payments on something you're not using, he said. l'll be happy when it sells. I'll be a happy guy.", "title": "Palin tries new tactic to unload hated jet: Gov.

{"message": "During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea. Trump said, \"China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.\" With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Koreas supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of \"total control.\" \"China does not control North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,\" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institutions Center for East Asia Policy Studies. Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager. \"Its similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,\" Ross said. \"Do the parents have total control? Perhaps  they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive  driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.\" Chinas leverage over North Korea The strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel. North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Koreas perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Koreas trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows. \"North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,\" Haggard told PolitiFact. Why total control is an exaggeration Yet while Chinas economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesnt mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trumps quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border. \"China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,\" Haggard said. It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesnt exactly listen to outsiders. \"Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,\" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. \"This is hardly control.\" Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the countrys national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance. \"North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,\" Revere said. \"This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.\" Indeed, despite North Koreas heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, \"it is not clear that the leadership cares,\" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. \"For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.\" Meanwhile, North Koreas development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates Chinas situation. This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb. \"China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,\" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Koreas Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.\" That does not sound like a country in \"total control\" of another. Trumps claim \"suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,\" Revere said. \"It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.\" Our ruling Trump said China has \"total control, just about, of North Korea.\" He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Koreas international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trumps assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean governments willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching \"total control\" over North Korea. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.", "title": "Donald Trump exaggerates when he says China has 'total control' over North Korea", "label": "real", "id": 574}
{"message": "By Sen. Rand Paul Videos by Rare Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid. One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran. We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did. RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to war Most importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will. Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years  particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president. John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised. None of this is secret. Its all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look. Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct, Bolton said just last year. Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. Iraq used to be no terrorists, Trump said in 2015. (N)ow its the Harvard of terrorism. If you look at Iraq from years ago, Im not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, Trump said of Saddam Hussein, but it was a lot better than it is right now. Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran. You cant learn from mistakes if you dont see mistakes. Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS  but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles. In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama for his refusal to directly target Gaddafi and declared, there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi But Obama missed it. In fact, Obama actually took Boltons advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, We came, we saw, he died. When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied 100 percent. Mr. Trump is 100 percent right. No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton. All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesnt deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded. Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, I hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility. Bolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that he had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy. But hes seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: Even before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives war-and-conquest agenda, notes The American Conservatives Jon Utley. At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy. The man is a menace. RELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans top priority will be to repeal Obamacare Our Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war. The true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support LORAIN, Ohio (AP)  Barack Obama accused Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday of trying to walk away from a long record of support for NAFTA, the free trade agreement that he said has cost 50,000 jobs in Ohio, site of next week's primary. At the same time, he said attempts to repeal the trade deal \"would probably result in more job losses than job gains in the United States.\" One day after Clinton angrily accused him of distorting her record on the North American Free Trade Agreement in mass mailings, the Illinois senator was eager to rekindle the long-distance debate, using passages from the former first lady's book as well as her own words. \"Ten years after NAFTA passed, Senator Clinton said it was good for America,\" Obama said. \"Well, I don't think NAFTA has been good for America  and I never have.\" \"The fact is, she was saying great things about NAFTA until she started running for president,\" Obama told an audience at a factory that makes wall board, located in a working class community west of Cleveland. \"A couple years after it passed, she said NAFTA was a 'free and fair trade agreement' and that it was 'proving its worth.' And in 2004, she said, \"I think, on balance, NAFTA has been good for New York and America,\" he said. The trade agreement has long been unpopular in the industrial Midwest, where critics blame it for lost jobs and shuttered factories, many of which once employed union workers who tend to vote Democratic. Ohio and Texas both hold primaries next week, with 334 delegates combined, and former President Clinton has said publicly his wife probably needs to win both of them if she is to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on March 4, but have far fewer delegates and have not attracted nearly as much attention. On another issue, Obama said he was not concerned that Republicans might attempt to depict him as unpatriotic if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Asked about a series of events, such as not placing his hand over his heart during the national anthem, he said, \"The way I will respond to it is with the truth. That I owe everything I am to this country.\" He also said patriotism had more than one definition, and that Republicans had presided over a war \"in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed\" or were sent into the war zone without enough training. Polls show Clinton with a narrowing lead in Ohio, where trade has long been a sensitive issue. Given that backdrop, the issue is the core of Obama's drive to win the Ohio primary and possibly force Clinton from the race. At the news conference, he noted that she had said Saturday that the agreement was negotiated by President George H.W. Bush, and passed and signed into law while her husband was in the White House. He said Clinton has \"essentially presented herself as co-president during the Clinton years. Every good thing that happened she says she was a part of and so the notion that you can selectively pick what you take credit for and then run away from what isnt politically convenient, that doesnt make sense.\" On Saturday, Clinton called attention to her plan to fix problems with NAFTA and a commitment against any future trade deals \"unless they are positive for American workers.\" To an audience of Boilermakers Union members and their families, Obama promised the same thing, with particular attention paid to labor and environmental concerns. \"Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that we can't stop globalization in its tracks and that some of these jobs aren't coming back,\" he said. \"But what I refuse to accept is that we have to stand idly by while workers watch their jobs get shipped overseas.\"", "title": "The Associated Press: Obama Hits Clinton on NAFTA Support", "label": "real", "id": 576}

Huckabee Crosses Picket LineAgain by Mike Hall, Feb 8, 2008 Television and movie writers who have been on strike since Nov. 5 will meet tomorrow in New York City and Los Angeles to discuss a potential tentative agreement that could end the strike. The Writers Guild of America members have been fighting to win a fair share of revenue for their work distributed online, through DVDs and other new media. Also on the strike front, Republican presidential candidate and former Gov. Mike Huckabee (Ark.) crossed another picket line (See below.). Officials of the Writers Guild of America, East ( WGAE), Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) have been meeting informally since Jan. 24, the first meetings between the two sides since the producers walked out of negotiations in December. In a letter to their members posted on both unions websites today, WGAE President Michael Winship and WGAW President Patric Verrone say: We are continuing to negotiate the terms of a tentative agreement with the AMPTP. We anticipate that we will be able to present the terms of that agreement to you in the next few days. In order to have a full discussion with you of the terms and how they were reached, and in order to get your input before making recommendations or decisions, we have scheduled membership meetings for current-active members only for this Sat., February 9, in New York and Los Angeles. We urge you to attend. We have gotten to this point in our negotiation as the direct result of the power of this strike, which each of you has generated. Neither the Negotiating Committee, nor the East Council or the West Board, will take action on any contract until after the membership meetings are held and your voices have been heard. We are all in this together. This afternoon, several hundred writers rallied and marched at the Time Warner Center in New York City. Both sides have agreed to a news blackout so details of the possible tentative agreement are not available. Meanwhile, Writers Guild members met Huckabee with angry resistance last night as he crossed a picket line to be a guest on The Colbert Report. This is how the WGAE website describes the episode: As his black SUV arrived outside the set, 20 or so picketers swarmed in close, shouting things such as Dont cross Governor! and This is a struck show! As Mr. Huckabees security team led him toward the guest entrance WGA members persisted in their attempt to persuade him not to cross, shouting and holding up signs that read Huckabee Dont Cross (Again)  and  Huckabee Supports Scabs. This strong union action was captured on film by reporters from CNN and NBC, who were there on the scene to record his appearance. Mr. Huckabee gained notoriety by being the first guest for Jay Leno the night the TV host returned to work without his writers on January 3rd. On Jan. 30, Republican front-runner Sen.

{"message": "Printer Friendly ASCE's 2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure assessed the condition and capacity of our nation's public works with an overall grade of D. ASCE estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to good condition. While long term solutions are needed, in the short term, small steps can be taken by the 110th Congress to improve our nation's failing infrastructure. The Cost The estimated total need of $1.6 trillion in federal, state and local funds is not all new money. Much of it is already allocated in existing budgets. However, existing funds have been repeatedly raided to pay for other programs. We estimate that approximately one-third of the total current investment needed will be new funding. It is also important to remember that the $1.6 trillion does not account for future population growth. Case studies of failing infrastructure . . . Kauai, Hawaii - March 2006 Seven people were killed when an earthen dam failed, unleashing nearly 300 million gallons of water, smashing down trees and sweeping away homes. Portland, Oregon - December 2006 A clogged sewer line caused a sink hole in Portland which swallowed a truck-which had been sent to clean the sewer. Natural gas and water lines were also ruptured in the accident. Washington County, Pennsylvania - December 2005 A 120-ton concrete beam collapsed onto Interstate 70 in Washington County, Pa., barely missing passing motorists. According to FHWA, 39 percent of bridges in Pennsylvania are unsafe. Atlanta, Georgia Congestion on Atlanta's roads costs the individual commuter 67 hours in wasted time each year and more than $1.7 billion, according to the Texas Transportation Institute. Action Steps National Infrastructure Commission Congress must enact the National Infrastructure Improvement Act to establish the National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States. The Commission would study the present condition of the nation's various infrastructure systems and report to Congress by 2009 on the capacity of our infrastructure to support the national economy, the age of the systems and possible methods to finance improvements. Aviation Congress must reauthorize funding for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and enact an increase in user fees as necessary for continued funding of the Airport Improvement Program. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems estimates that over the next five years (2005-2009) $39.5 billion will be needed to meet the infrastructure demands of all segments of civil aviation. In March 2005, the FAA forecasted total passenger enplanements would surpass 1 billion annually within the next ten years, representing a 41 percent increase from 2005. The current funding authority expires October 1, 2007, and with the projected increase in passenger traffic, airports are at risk for seasonal and peak-period delays. Bridges, Roads  and  Transit Congress must fully fund surface transportation programs authorized under SAFETEA-LU. Congress must use all funds that accumulate in the Highway Trust Fund to invest in the nation's surface transportation program. Poor road conditions cost U.S. motorists $54 billion a year in repairs and operating costs?$275 per motorist- and congestion on the nation's roadways costs drivers $63.1 billion a year. However, the $59.4 billion spent annually is well below the $94 billion needed each year to improve transportation infrastructure conditions nationally. Also, in 2004, Americans took 9.6 billion trips using public transportation. Since 1995, public transportation ridership in the U.S. has grown by more than 23 percent, faster than highway travel. Brownfields Congress must reauthorize the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2002 in order to provide continued federal funding for the redevelopment of brownfields sites. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 172 cities estimated that they collectively have more than 23,810 brownfields sites, with the average size of a brownfield site being between five and 15 acres. Also, 158 cities collectively estimated that their brownfield properties comprised 96,039 acres of land, representing potential new jobs and land tax revenue. Dams  and  Levees Congress must enact the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act (H.R. 1098) to address the most critical non-federal public dams. Congress must enact a national levee safety program, including a nationwide inventory of levees and mandatory inspection requirements. State dam safety officials estimate that $10 billion is needed to repair the most critical dams over the next 12 years. Also, state dam safety programs have identified more than 3,500 unsafe or deficient dams, many of which are susceptible to large flood events or earthquakes. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported in early 2007 that nearly 150 U.S. levees pose an unacceptable risk of failing in a major flood, mainly due to poor maintenance. The nation cannot afford to wait for another flooding catastrophe like the one that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Drinking Water  and  Wastewater Congress must enact the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007 (H.R. 720) to provide vitally needed federal aid through the State Revolving Loan Fund (CWSRF) program. Congress must authorize $1 billion in annual funding for the Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF). The EPA estimates that nearly $1 trillion is needed in critical drinking water and wastewater investments over the next two decades. At risk are the gains that have been made in cleaning up the nation's rivers, lakes, and streams since the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Inland Waterways Congress must enact a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) that requires a more comprehensive approach to water resources projects constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Congress must ensure the integrity of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Of the 257 locks on the more than 12,000 miles of inland waterways operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, nearly 50 percent are functionally obsolete. By 2020, that number will increase to 80 percent. The cost to replace the present system of locks is more than $125 billion. ASCE's 2005 Report Card for America's Infrastructure assessed the condition and capacity of our nation's public works with an overall grade of D. ASCE estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to good condition.

{"message": "Rising to a New Generation of Global Challenges Mitt Romney From Foreign Affairs, July/August 2007 Summary: Washington is as divided on foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. As the \"greatest generation\" did before us, we must move beyond political camps to unite around bold actions in order to build a strong America and a safer world. We must strengthen our military and economy, achieve energy independence, reenergize civilian and interagency capabilities, and revitalize our alliances. Mitt Romney, Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Topics: U.S. policy and politics National security and defense WASHINGTON DIVIDED Less than six years after 9/11, Washington is as divided and conflicted over foreign policy as it has been at any point in the last 50 years. Senator Arthur Vandenberg once famously declared that \"politics stops at the water's edge\"; today, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declares that our major political parties should carry out two separate foreign policies. The Senate unanimously confirmed General David Petraeus, who pledged to implement a new strategy, as the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. Yet just weeks later, the Senate began crafting legislation specifically designed to stop that new strategy. More broadly, lines have been drawn between those labeled \"realists\" and those labeled \"neoconservatives.\" Yet these terms mean little when even the most committed neoconservative recognizes that any successful policy must be grounded in reality and even the most hardened realist admits that much of the United States' power and influence stems from its values and ideals. In the midst of these divisions, the American people -- and many others around the world -- have increasing doubts about the United States' direction and role in the world. Indeed, it seems that concern about Washington's divisiveness and capability to meet today's challenges is the one thing that unites us all. We need new thinking on foreign policy and an overarching strategy that can unite the United States and its allies -- not around a particular political camp or foreign policy school but around a shared understanding of how to meet a new generation of challenges. A GENERATION'S LEGACY OF LEADERSHIP Today's challenges are daunting. They include the conflict in Iraq, the resurgence of the Taliban, and global terrorist networks made even more menacing by the threat of nuclear proliferation. While Iran's leaders relentlessly pursue nuclear weapons capabilities and spout genocidal threats against Israel, the world largely stands silent, unable to agree on effective sanctions even as each day the danger grows. Genocide ravages Darfur even as the world stands frozen. In Latin America, leaders such as Venezuelan President Hugo Chvez seek to reverse the spread of freedom and return to failed authoritarian policies. AIDS and potential new pandemics threaten us in an interconnected world. The economic rise of China and other countries across Asia poses a different type of challenge. It is easy to understand why Americans -- and many others around the world -- feel so much unease and uncertainty. Yet although we face fundamentally different issues today, the United States has a history of rising to meet even greater challenges. Indeed, we need not look to ancient history, but only to the courage and determination of our parents and grandparents to see a stark contrast with the confusion and infighting of Washington today. Just over 60 years ago, we were in the midst of a global war that would take the lives of tens of millions. The outcome was far from certain. General Dwight Eisenhower drafted a short note before the D-day landings at Normandy accepting full responsibility \"in case of failure.\" The invasion did not fail. Yet no sooner had we defeated fascism than we were engaged in a 50-year struggle with communism. Those whom the journalist Tom Brokaw memorialized as \"the greatest generation\" made the tough choices that allowed us to prevail in these struggles. And it was not just our Washington leaders who were decisive. In the 1940s, Americans rationed and saved, and mothers and daughters enlisted to work in factories. Together with the GIs who returned home, they built this country's prosperity and fueled a sense of optimism. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, America pursued learning and innovation to lead the world in space, technology, and productivity -- outcompeting the Soviets and driving them to an economic bankruptcy that matched their moral bankruptcy. In the aftermath of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members of \"the greatest generation\" united America and the free world around shared values and actions that changed history. They unified U.S. military and security efforts, creating the Department of Defense and the National Security Council. They rethought U.S. approaches to the world, building the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and the Peace Corps. They forged alliances, such as NATO, that magnified the power of freedom and created a world trading system that helped launch the greatest expansion of economic and political freedom and development in history. Our times call for equally bold leadership and for a renewed sense of service and shared sacrifice among Americans and our allies around the world.

{"message": "A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran. The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a \"broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists.\" A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya. A female voiceover says, \"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology.\" (The words \"an apology\" flash across the screen.) Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, \"Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.\" The voiceover says, \"He reached out.\" Obama: \"It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran.\" Voiceover: \"Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. Its time to stop Iran.\" The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth. His first interview Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiyas Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias. News coverage at the time billed the interview as Obamas \"first television interview in the White House,\" according to the New York Times, and \"his first formal television interview as president,\" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new presidents first. The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obamas diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office. So its fair to say this was Obamas first interview as president. No apology The interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians. Obama responds: Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response. Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table. And it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress. The ad uses only his comments, \"Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.\" But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies. In addition, we dont agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect. Later, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, \"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.\" Nowhere in the interview did Obama use the word \"apology,\" \"apologize\" or \"sorry.\" PolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world. But again, there isnt an \"Im sorry\" anywhere to be found in Obamas speeches or remarks. One expert weve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. \"It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,\" John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. \"Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.\" Our ruling Secure America Nows ad says, \"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology.\" The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized. Obamas first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that. By saying \"all too often the United States starts by dictating,\" Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. Whats more, the ad criticizes Obamas approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.", "title": "Ad says Obama apologized, showed weakness on Iran", "label": "real", "id": 581}
{"message": "One in Four Congressman Joe Pitts  Follow 3 min read  Mar 10, 2016 -- 3 Listen Share One out of every four Pennsylvania households is affected by addiction. More than 2,400 Pennsylvanians died from overdoses last year, making it the leading cause of accidental death in our Commonwealth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms. More than 4 million Americans abuse prescription drugs or painkillers; another 435,000 use heroin. These facts are shocking, but they reflect the reality right here in our neighborhoods, in Reading, in Lancaster City, and across Pennsylvania. It is happening to Democrats and Republicans, to people of every race and religion. It happens to our friends, family members, and neighbors. We all know them. And we share their pain. No one suffers alone. We dont have the option to think of this as merely a private or personal issue. Every addict comes from a family, and has people who love them and suffer with them. It can be almost unbearable to watch someone you love endure the physical and mental effects of drug abuse. Every addiction hurts not only an addict, but an entire community. All of us pay the price of addiction, too, because it keeps people from fulfilling their potential and contributing more fully to our society. Drug abuse contributes to unemployment, homelessness, and sex trafficking. It puts pressure on government programs and budgets. Ninety percent of addicts who need treatment dont get it. Our health care system is failing not only them, but it is failing all of us. Addiction is treatable. We need to treat it, and we need to educate our young people properly in order to prevent the spread of addiction. At a time when political acrimony is reaching a record level, leaders in both parties are coming together to find solutions. At the state level, Governor Wolf has ordered every state police vehicle to carry naloxone, an anti-overdose drug that has already saved hundreds of lives. Congress likewise is working on a bipartisan basis, with the support of the Obama Administration, to make the system work better. This week, the Senate passed comprehensive legislation to address the addiction crisis. The bill was the result of bipartisan effort, and passed with bipartisan support from both of Pennsylvanias Senators. In November, Congress passed and the President signed into law a bipartisan bill, the Protecting Our Infants Act, to review federal programs to help the newborns of heroin and opiate addicts. Tragically, thousands of babies are exposed to and addicted to drugs like codeine, morphine, or heroin before they are even born. Doctors are able to take these babies through the withdrawal process, however. Our new law will require the federal government to develop a strategy to address any gaps in current research or programs. In 2015, the Energy and Commerce Committees Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held five hearings on the drug abuse crisis. In October, as Chairman of the Health Subcommittee, I chaired a two-part hearing at which we heard from experts like the Obama Administrations drug czar Michael Botticelli and Dr. Kenneth Katz of the Lehigh Valley Health Network. Their testimony was as chilling as it was informative. Director Botticelli testified that over the past decade, the number of people treated for overdoses each year, and the number of babies born with neo-natal abstinence syndrome have both tripled. Dr. Katz told us about a number of adolescents in Allentown whom he has seen hospitalized and even killed after trying a new synthetic strand of cannabis. At the hearing, we discussed seven bipartisan proposals that would improve federal public health policies and help addicts get treatment. Each of these seven bills deals with a different aspect of the epidemic, because we need a comprehensive plan: not just adequate funding, but targeted funding; not just emergency response, but education and prevention. These bills would make a number of changes to existing law. They would expand the number of physicians who can prescribe the drug buprenorphine to addicts, develop best practices and a national awareness campaign, ban certain synthetic drugs, help pregnant women who are addicted, and create a patient tracking pilot program. We arent finished. Congress will continue to take action on behalf of the families and communities across Pennsylvania and across the country being shattered by this public health crisis. We will work until the system works. ###", "title": "One in Four", "label": "real", "id": 582}
{"message": "On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perrys years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nations 40th president. \"Youre sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?\" Hannity asked. Perry replied that hed had a conversation with Reagans son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. \"I told Michael Reagan the other day  You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican, but I said, I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did. \" Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point? Well take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that \"Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.\" Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagans Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, \"was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.\" Yager said that he hadnt seen copies of Reagans voter registration cards but that \"virtually all the sources that refer to\" Reagans party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan \"has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times\" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948. Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagans presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956  at ages 41 and 45, respectively  and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 \"while remaining a Democrat.\" Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7. The librarys website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixons unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. \"When he said, Well, no, I havent yet, but I intend to, down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, Im a registrar, and placed a registration card in front of him,\" the site says. \"In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.\" In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: \"I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.'' Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yagers book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan \"was an active Democrat\" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, \"and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.\" In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he \"didnt want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans\" and would re-register as a Republican. \"He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,\" Cannon writes. So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier. How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move? Weve looked at Perrys political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, taking a West Texas House district seat in 1984, when Democrats controlled the Legislature and the state had had just one Republican governor since Reconstruction. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties in 1989 to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990  a race that Perry won in an upset. The biography on Perrys presidential campaign website agrees with that account. A July 14 Texas Tribune story says that during his years in the Texas House, Perry was far from liberal. \"Perry, a young rancher and cotton farmer, gained an early reputation as a fiscal conservative,\" the story says. \"He was one of a handful of freshman pit bulls, so named because they sat in the lower pit of the House Appropriations Committee, where they fought to keep spending low.\" The Tribune story says Perry announced he was changing parties on Sept. 29, 1989, during a press conference outside the Texas Capitol. \"I intend to vote the same convictions,\" Perry said then, according to the Tribune. \"The only difference is there will be an R beside my name.\" On the day of the press conference, Perry was 39 years old.

{"message": "WASHINGTON  U.S. troops could withdraw from Iraq within months, but if Iraq's government remains politically deadlocked, it probably would collapse and the nation would descend into chaos, a war game organized by the U.S. Army concluded earlier this month. The war gamers, following a scenario created by their Army hosts, determined that U.S. troops would secure the exit route to Kuwait through largely Shiite Muslim southern Iraq and face little fighting as they drove their equipment out. Any attacks, the panel judged, would be \"harassment attacks,\" likely by a few Sunni members of al Qaida in Iraq who wanted to attack American troops one last time. \"Why would they stop us? They have been telling us to leave,\" said one participant who requested anonymity to speak freely about the war game. Once U.S. troops left, however, the chaos in Iraq would escalate. Shiite militias would drive Baghdad's Sunni population into Iraq's western Anbar province, which is almost exclusively Sunni, the war gamers concluded. There would be a power struggle within Anbar among tribes backed by outside Sunni Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Syria. Rival Shiite factions would fight one another to control much of the rest of the country, and Iran presumably would back one side, although the gamers couldn't assess how overt Iranian interference would be. Turkey would consider entering Iraq from the north to thwart the Kurds, who desire independence and claim some of Turkey as part of their homeland. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's government would be unable to control the country. Indeed, the gamers concluded, his government could collapse unless Iran threw its support behind it. \"The mess we would leave behind would be awful,\" the participant said. \"The ethnic cleansing is happening now. Once we're gone, absent a political solution that would allow the Iraqi Army to go into action, all of that will be accelerated.\" The Army staged the one-day exercise earlier this month at a Hilton hotel in suburban Springfield, Va., and invited 30 Iraq experts, among them serving and retired officers and Iraqi exiles. The organizers picked April 2008 as a starting point  the month after which U.S. commanders have said they can't maintain the surge of additional U.S. forces and still give troops a year off between 15-month deployments  and January 2009 as the end. They played the roles of the Sunnis, the Shiites, the insurgents, the militias, the military generals and the Iraqi government. The game was one of several simulations of what Iraq might look like in the 2009 time frame if U.S. troops leave, said retired Marine Col. Gary Anderson, who participated in the Springfield exercise and several previous such games. But he said the Army hasn't yet staged an exercise premised on an abrupt withdrawal. That the military war games are focusing on the potential chaos in Iraq, rather than an abrupt troop withdrawal, offers some insight into how the Pentagon is planning for the next stage of the war, several of the participants told McClatchy Newspapers. \"It will be as easy to get out as it was to get in,\" said one senior defense official, who declined to speak on the record about possible future operations. He said he believes that U.S. forces could get out of Iraq in as little as six months. But the military insists that there's no withdrawal plan at this time. \"Tell us the policy, and we will do it,\" one senior Pentagon official said. Critics said the military is underestimating how hard it'll be to get out of Iraq. They point to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, which boosted the fortunes of the militant Shiite Islamic group Hezbollah, and the Soviet Union's hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan, which cost more than 500 Soviet troops their lives. Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., a retired Navy vice admiral who was director of defense policy for the National Security Council in the Clinton administration, said he believes that drawing down or withdrawing troops could be one of the most dangerous periods of the Iraq war. \"The military will be vulnerable ... You are going to go out in a combat situation,\" Sestak said. \"I think we can do greater damage if we don't have a firm grasp on the military implications.\" U.S. troops are likely to leave an Iraq that's still embroiled in fierce sectarian violence, he said. \"How quickly can the military move its 160,000 troops out? What about the 100,000-plus contractors? How many of the military's 45,000 Humvees should be left behind for the Iraqi Army? Which of 64 military bases should be closed? How does the military protect its main route out of Iraq toward Kuwait?\" Sestak estimates that it would take at long as two years to withdraw. America's future in Iraq will be at center stage next month, when Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. envoy there, give an assessment and recommendation to Congress on Iraq's security and political situation. The war gamers' only issue was getting out and at what cost. By the end of the game, the players decided that the exercise had \"captured how bad it would be,\" said the participant who declined to be identified. \"I don't worry about how we will get out of Iraq,\" Anderson concluded about the latest war game. \"I am worried about the Iraqis we will kill on the way out.\"", "title": "Iraq pullout could create chaos", "label": "real", "id": 584}

And the Cleveland Plain Dealer examined Senator Obama's attacks on me regarding NAFTA and said they were erroneous. So I would hope that, again, we can get to a debate about what the real issues are and where we stand because we do need to fix NAFTA. It is not working. It was, unfortunately, heavily disadvantaging many of our industries, particularly manufacturing. I have a record of standing up for that, of chairing the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate, and I will take a tough position on these trade agreements. MR. WILLIAMS: Senator, thank you. Before we turn the questioning over to Tim Russert, Senator Obama. SEN. OBAMA: Well, I think that it is inaccurate for Senator Clinton to say that she's always opposed NAFTA. In her campaign for Senate, she said that NAFTA, on balance, had been good for New York and good for America. I disagree with that. I think that it did not have the labor standards and environmental standards that were required in order to not just be good for Wall Street but also be good for Main Street. And if you travel through Youngstown and you travel through communities in my home state of Illinois, you will see entire cities that have been devastated as a consequence of trade agreements that were not adequately structured to make sure that U.S. workers had a fair deal. Now, I think that Senator Clinton has shifted positions on this and believes that we should have strong environmental standards and labor standards, and I think that's a good thing. But you know, when I first moved to Chicago in the early '80s and I saw steelworkers who had been laid off of their plants -- black, white, and Hispanic -- and I worked on the streets of Chicago to try to help them find jobs, I saw then that the net costs of many of these trade agreements, if they're not properly structured, can be devastating. And as president of the United States, I intend to make certain that every agreement that we sign has the labor standards, the environmental standards and the safety standards that are going to protect not just workers, but also consumers. We can't have toys with lead paint in them that our children are playing with. We can't have medicines that are actually making people more sick instead of better because they're produced overseas.

Today, Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I am proud to stand firm for the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Folks, Barack and I come from very different places, but we share a common story. An American story. He was the son of a single mom, a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids. But she raised him. She raised him to believe in America. to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams. If you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe, it's a saying Barack you heard me say before, my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it. That's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, is there no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election. Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it, that American dream under eight years of Bush and McCain, that American dream is slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it in your lives. You see it in your shrinking wages, and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station. It keeps going up and up and up, and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams. You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a mere political saying. I say with every fiber of my being I believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this. We cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans while the middle class America, middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking. We can't afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse. As you know, it's not just the millions of people facing foreclosure. It's the tens of millions of your neighbors who are seeing the values of their homes drop off a cliff along with their dreams. Ladies and gentlemen, your kitchen table is like mine. You sit there at night before you put the kids -- after you put the kids to bed and you talk, you talk about what you need. You talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not a worry John McCain has to worry about. It's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at. Folks, again, it's not political sloganary when I say we literally can't afford four more years of this non- energy policy written by and for the oil companies, making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally, not figuratively, literally putting America's security at risk, we can't afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the bad news. But there is good news, America. We don't have to have four more years of George W. Bush. And John McCain. The next President of the United States is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in American history since Franklin Roosevelt. He will have such an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity, not only to change the direction of America, but literally, literally to change the direction of the world. Barack Obama and I believe, we believe with every fiber in our being that our families, our communities as Americans, there's not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the American people.

Statement by Ros-Lehtinen and King: It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Raufs trip to the Middle East. Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is  a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Departments selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administrations policy and funding priorities. Background: In an interview televised just 19 days after the attacks against America on September 11, 2001, Abdul Rauf cast blame for them on the U.S. He called the attacks a reaction against the U.S. Government politically I wouldnt say that the United States deserved what happened, but United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened We have been accessory to a lot of innocent lives dying in the world. In fact, in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the USA. Note: On Monday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called Abdul Rauf a distinguished Muslim cleric and noted that the State Department send[s] people from Muslim communities here in this country around the world to help people overseas understand our society and the role of religion within our society. ######", "title": "U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs", "label": "real", "id": 587}
{"message": "Press Release Sanders Supports Gun Safety Bill January 16, 2016 Twitter Facebook Email Link CHARLESTON, S.C.  U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday made good on his promise to support legislation to amend a 2005 law on firearms manufacturers liability. Im pleased that this legislation is being introduced, Sanders said of proposals by Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam Schiff to rescind portions of a law granting broad immunity from lawsuits to gun manufacturers and dealers. As I have said for many months now, we need to look at the underlying law and tighten it up, Sanders added. Sanders called it good news that the Senate and House bills proposed by Blumenthal and Schiff would leave in place provisions in the 2005 law that require child safety locks on guns and ban armor-piercing ammunition. Those were important provisions that I did support, he said. Sanders also renewed his concern that the law should not subject the owners of small gun stores, which have not acted negligently, to lawsuits. As I have said, I do want to make sure that this legislation does not negatively impact small gun stores in rural America that serve the hunting community. So Im pleased to support the legislation and should it come up for consideration I would work to make sure it includes a provision that allows us to monitor its impact so that we may determine if it is having any unintended consequences. Sanders proposed amendment to the Blumenthal and Schiff bills would require the Commerce Department to monitor and report on the laws impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores. Sanders amendment would add this section to the proposed legislation: Sec. 3. Protection of non-negligent rural mom and pop hunting stores. The Secretary of Commerce shall monitor the impact of this statute, if any, on the availability of hunting supplies, including firearms, in rural communities from non-negligent local sellers. Within six months of enactment, and every six months thereafter, the Secretary shall transmit the results of the monitoring to the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate, respectively.", "title": "Sanders Supports Gun Safety Bill", "label": "real", "id": 588}
{"message": "This is a rush transcript from \"On the Record,\" February 2, 2010. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX NEWS HOST: Senator Judd Gregg just blasted the president's budget director, Peter Orszag, about President Obama's proposal to use TARP funds to help community banks lend to small businesses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JUDD GREGG, R-N.H., BUDGET COMMITTEE: The whole concept of the TARP was that as we recoup the money, it would -- because we were borrowing it from our -- from Americans and from the Chinese -- and as we recoup that money, we would use it to pay down the debt. Now that's not going to happen. We're going to -- it's become a piggy bank. PETER ORSZAG, OMB DIRECTOR: Well, Senator... GREGG: It's a piggy bank which adds to our deficit, adds to our debt and gets put (INAUDIBLE) tax. ORSZAG: The degree to which shifting funds would add to our debt or deficits depends on what the net subsidy rate would be on that new activity. And remember, the purpose of TARP was to address problems in our financial markets. One of the -- and it has been remarkably successful in bringing credit spreads back down to normal levels. One of the lingering problems in our financial markets, however, is access to credit for small businesses. It's why in this budget, we're... GREGG: No, no, no! You can't make that type of statement with any legitimacy! ORSZAG: OK. GREGG: You cannot make that statement! This is the law! ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) they're not suffering from (INAUDIBLE) GREGG: Let me tell you what the law says! ORSZAG: ... lack of access... GREGG: Let me read it to you again because you don't appear to understand the law! The law is very clear! \"The monies recouped from the TARP shall be paid into the general fund of the treasury for the reduction of the public debt.\" It's not for a piggy bank because you're concerned about lending to small businesses... ORSZAG: (INAUDIBLE) requirement (INAUDIBLE) GREGG: ... and you want to get a political event when you go out and make a speech in Nashua, New Hampshire. That's not what this money's for! This money is to reduce the debt of our children! (END VIDEO CLIP) VAN SUSTEREN: Ouch! Well, for the inside story on that showdown, we went to Capitol Hill and Senator Gregg went \"On the Record.\" (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VAN SUSTEREN: Senator, nice to see you, sir. GREGG: Greta, thank you for having me. Thank you very much. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, thank you for letting us come to your office. GREGG: Appreciate you coming in. VAN SUSTEREN: All right, today you had quite a showdown with the -- with Peter Orszag. GREGG: Well, you know, they've sent up a budget which by their own terms is unsustainable. It puts us on a path which is basically going to lead us to fiscal insolvency as a nation, in my opinion, and I think in a lot of other people's opinion. It's a huge deficit machine, is what they've proposed, and that leads to debt. And the debt is not sustainable. It gets passed on to our kids, and basically, will lower the quality of life of our children, and that's not fair. I feel very strongly that when you send a budget like that up, you should also send up some fairly big ideas for how you're going to address it in the out years, how you're going to keep us from going off the road, how you're going to keep us from passing on to our kids a nation that can be afforded. And there are no big ideas in this budget on the issue of fiscal discipline. None. There are some -- there are some ideas, and I support their freeze concept. But the freeze is $10 billion. Compared to a $1.6 trillion deficit, it's really not going to get us there. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, one of the things that he brought up that, obviously, you were quite heated about, was the whole idea of taking some of the returned TARP money and giving it to community banks to the tune of $30 billion for lending. You say that that's not legal or not authorized by the statute. GREGG: No. The way TARP was set up, you know, we borrowed this money -- we borrowed it from Americans and we borrowed it from the Chinese, and we took it and we used it to stabilize the financial industry during a severe crisis which would have basically bankrupted Main Street, had all these banks failed. VAN SUSTEREN: So (INAUDIBLE) just set aside some cash... GRAHAM: No, this is not in a drawer somewhere. We had to go out and borrow it. And as part of that decision, there is very clear language put in the bill -- I wrote it, that's why I know it was clear -- that said when the money comes back -- and we expected it to come back, and in many cases, coming back with interest, so we're actually making money on it -- the money has to be used, shall be used to reduce the debt. That's what the law says. That's what TARP says. That was intentionally put in there so that the money could not be used as a piggy bank for whatever the initiative is, no matter how good an idea it is. Now the president is suggesting that he wants to take $30 billion of the paid back funds and use it for some other initiative. Well, that's not consistent with the law and it's not consistent with what we should do, basically. We should reduce the debt with this money. If we -- if we terminated TARP today, which we should, we would reduce the debt over the next couple of years by $200 billion $300 billion. That's a big chunk of debt reduction. And it -- and that's exactly what we should be doing with this TARP money. We shouldn't be using it to create a new program here, a new program there, depending on which way the wind is blowing on some given day. VAN SUSTEREN: Well, the word that I seized upon in listening to the exchange today is \"shall.\" And when I was in law school, that wasn't a word that gave you any sort of wiggle room. It just must be. How does the -- how does the White House, the administration, justify saying that they can take the returned TARP money and send it out to these community banks, this $30 billion for loans? How do they justify it? GREGG: Well, the word is \"shall,\" and they can't do it legally. VAN SUSTEREN: So what happens? GREGG: So Mr. Orszag, to his credit, said they're going to change the law. You know, I mean, well, that makes no sense at all! I mean, the whole purpose here was to borrow money, put it out, stabilize the financial markets. When it gets paid back, pay down the borrowing so our kids didn't get stuck with the debt. What they're going to do is change the law so that they borrow the money, send it out to the stabilized financial institutions. When it gets paid back, they're going to spend it on something else so the debt is still out there and our kids still have to pay for it. VAN SUSTEREN: Do you think he knew the word \"shall\" was there before he showed up today? GREGG: No. VAN SUSTEREN: Or did you surprise him with \"shall\"? GREGG: I'm not sure whether he knew it or not, but he pretty quickly confirmed that they were going to change the law. So he probably did know, yes. I guess I probably would have to give him credit for knowing it, yes. VAN SUSTEREN: So I take it you're not a big fan of the president's proposed budget. GREGG: No, the budget is a disaster. It really is. It's more government, more spending and more debt. But the real problem isn't the short run. The short run's a problem. But the real problem is in the out years, there's no compression of the delta. Spending continues to go up, and taxes can never catch it because the spending is going up so fast. They're taking the size of the government from 20 percent of the Gross National Product up to 25, 26 percent of the Gross National Product. That's simply not affordable. That means you're adding a trillion dollars of debt to our kids' backs every year for the foreseeable future. And at the end of 10 years, not only is it not coming down, it's still going up! VAN SUSTEREN: So what -- so if we were having this conversation 10 years from now, what would the economy look like, according to your prediction, assuming the president's proposed budget got passed? GREGG: I personally think we'll hit the wall long before 10 years. I think within 5 to 7 years... VAN SUSTEREN: What does that mean, \"hit the wall\"? GREGG: It means that people have -- the people stop buying our debt or making it very difficult for us to sell debt, that the value of the currency is affected and that you either end up with a significant inflationary event or an event where you have to so significantly raise taxes that you reduce the productivity of the entire economy and you're no longer creating jobs. The simple situation -- the simple comparison is this. It's like a family that's been living beyond its means for many, many years and its income can never catch up with its debts. And at some point, the world community says to us, I'm sorry, we're not going to fund your debts any longer. We're simply not going to lend you the money you need. I mean, we're not operating off our own economy's ability to support us, we're operating because China is willing to lend us money and other nations are willing to lend us money. Well, they're putting up some fairly significant red flags right now that says, We're a little concerned about all your borrowing. And if we continue this borrowing, they're going to put up very severe red flags and say, Hey, maybe we're just not going to lend you anymore, or if we do lend to you, we're going to put a price on the lending which is so expensive that it makes it very hard for you to do much else with your government besides pay down your interest.

During an appearance on Current TVs Viewpoint on Tuesday, Sanders blasted Republicans for blocking the legislation. What really frightens me is not just the disastrous nature of Citizens United, but the whole trend that we are seeing lately, economically, of moving this country toward an oligarchic form of government, he said. What you have right now is incredibly unequal distribution of wealth and income the Walton family of Walmart itself owns more wealth  one family  than the bottom 40 percent of the American people. Youve got that reality out there, and then whats happening now  what Citizens United is about  is these guys are not content to own the economy, to own the wealth of America, they now want to own lock, stock and barrel the political process as well.

The white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the white question will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation. Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.

Alison Jackson is renown for her explorations into how photography and the cult of the celebrity have transformed our relationship to what is real. Her notorious photographic portraits, life-like sculptures, films and videos are startlingly realistically staged affairs that cast uncannily styled actors into an entirely fathomable projection of a future that could have been; or the intimate, often salacious, imagined private moments of media icons such as Diana Princess of Wales, the Queen of England, Marilyn Monroe, George Bush, Brad and Angelina, and David Beckham. Jacksons productions stress-test the implicit belief that a photograph can capture a frozen moment of truth. At best, a photograph of a celebrity reproduces something authentic only at the very moment the shutter clicks says the artist yet we have been teased into giving these moments an absolute and unquestioned authority. However, what we actually do is create a narcissistic circle where we assert our control over the object of desire: we transform our celebrities into what we want. This whole projective process is further exaggerated by our capacity for fantasy and the inherently titillating nature of the image of a celebrity like Marilyn in flagrante. In this way, my productions, charged with desire, have become more real than the real life model they are based on, evolving into a mental image rather than a direct record of reality Jacksons staging, her subversive form of social commentary which has its historical roots in artist William Hogarth, strips away the veneer of PR and hype that prop up the celebrities that come under her scrutiny. Unlike the paparazzi photo, where the actual real celebrity is caught on film in a frozen moment in time, Jacksons productions  where the likenesses are recognisable  use the celebrity aura to address a deeper universal lineage, the archetypal characters that define the history of human identity and the often humorous struggle of how they cope in the age of mass mediation.", "title": "Mental Images", "label": "fake", "id": 604}

The Queens fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony. Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign. PA Wire/AP While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944. She received Susan as a gift after becoming attached to her father King George VIs corgi called Dookie, the Daily Mail reported. Since then, she has owned dozens of the breed, known for its distinctive short legs and standing-up ears. Such was Queen Elilzabeths attachment to Susan, she reportedly took the dog on honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947. The royal couple have also owned \"dorgies\" -- a cross between a dachshund and a corgi. Anwar Hussein/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II with her corgis in 1969.

Muslims continually prove that they have little intentions into assimilating into western civilization or adhering to our nations laws after arriving to America from their third world countries. Our generosity to these savages is frequently repaid by insolence, as many Muslims are constantly busted at the center of welfare fraud rings, as they seek to scam the very country who has given them so much. In yet another case of blatant disregard for for our nations laws, a group of Muslim doctors in Detroit have just been busted as the masterminds behind a $1.3 billion dollar fraudulent scheme, leading to the arrests of 412 people overnight, in the largest scam that the United States Department of Justice has ever seen. The scam involves a scheme where Muslim doctors will write massive quantities of prescriptions for opioids. These drugs never land in the hands of patients however, as the Muslims will them make fraudulent claims to Medicaid and pocket the money. Additionally, the drugs often wind of on the streets as part of a huge back-alley drug operation. The U.S. Justice Department is calling this prescription drug and health care fraud scheme the largest operation of its kind in American history, naming several Michigan Muslim doctors responsible for orchestrating this huge criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. ClickonDetroit.com has more: Officials have made 412 arrests nationwide, including 56 doctors and targeting 200 clinics. The Justice Department said those arrested are responsible for $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions. Federal officials said a group of Michigan doctors was responsible for a major chunk of the scheme. One of the clinics hit in the sting operations is in Farmington. Federal officials said the opioid epidemic is part of it, but the medical office and a number of others were set up specifically as a criminal enterprise to rip off Medicare. Federal officers raided the Fisher Building Wednesday, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said their work accounted for 10 percent of the scams value. Six doctors in Michigan prescribed patients with unnecessary opioids, some of which ended up for sale on the streets, Sessions said. A physician group called Global Quality used to operate out of a Woodward Avenue office building. The ring leader of the massive Medicare scam is Muslim Mashiyat Rashid, who profited with an astounding $164 million from the fraud. He had had no qualms about rubbing the American taxpayers noses in what he stole from them, frequently bragging about his large piles of cash on social media. Heres an image he posted on Facebook where he poses beside his Bentely sedan and corporate jetall bought and paid for with the Medicare money he scammed from the American taxpayer. Other nauseating pictures show Rashid standing at the NBA finals with his court-side tickets, enjoying a life of opulence he enjoyed while screwing over the American people. Rashids name is included in court documents as Feds prepare their case for trial, where Muslim doctors Joseph Betro, Spilios Pappas, Abdul Haq, Tariz Omar and Mohammad Zahoor were busted working directly with Rashid in recent years to make their millions. More than 400 others across the country were charged late last week for taking part in the health care scam in connection with a raid last week at the Fisher Building in Detroit. Other Muslim defendants include: Mashiyat Rashid, of Oakland County  controlled, owned or operated Global Quality, Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians, Tri-State Physicians, New Center Medical, National Laboratories, and Tri-County Wellness; Yasser Mozeb, of Oakland County  allegedly received payments from Global Quality and Tri-County Wellness; Abdul Haq, of Washtenaw County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Aqua Therapy, Tri-County Physicians and Tri-State Physicians; Joseph Betro, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians and New Center Medical; Tariz Omar, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians. Mohammed Zahoor, of Oakland County, physician enrolled as a participating provider with Medicare for Tri-County Physicians. Trumps Justice Department isnt messing around, as the defendants are being brought up on a plethora of federal charges, including five counts of health care fraud and health care fraud conspiracy. Rashid has additionally been charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States and money laundering, receipt of kickbacks in connection with a federal health care program, and payment of kickbacks in connection with federal health care program. In all, investigators say that Rashids companies fraudulently billed Medicare $126 million, with a total of $1.3 billion in similar scams across the country. We must continue to sound the alarm about whats going right underneath our noses. This isnt the first time that Muslims have ripped off Americans with fraud, and with the hordes of migrants that liberals keep fighting to bring into our country, stories like this will sadly become the new norm if the American people do not wake the hell up soon!", "title": "412 Michigan Muslims Arrested In Feds LARGEST BUST IN U.S. HISTORY", "label": "fake", "id": 611}

Just when you thought it couldnt get darker or colder outside, the fear-mongering conspiracy theorists are here to tell you youre wrong If you can suspend reality long enough to believe Jupiter and Venus will collide on Monday in an astronomical space collision and subsequent global blackout, just because they said so in their falsified NASA statement.

The far-fetched claim continued: According to the [NASA] report, Venus and Jupiter will engaged in a close parallelism, only being separated by one degree. NASA Now, to fan the flames of this fabricated fire, some clever cloggs has even gone as far as to publish a false statement. The statement purported to be written by NASA official Charles Boden  who must be pretty angry right now  confirmed the world would be plunged into darkness from November 15 and November 29. NASA The statement read: NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2017. The event, according to NASA, hasnt occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the November Black Out event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.

Hillary has gone into hiding as Humas neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiners recent conviction. On Tuesday evening, a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a New York apartment block where Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin own a home. The 48-year-old, who police say lived at the premises, was found unconscious inside the machine and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her cause of death has yet to be announced by the medical examiner. Police had been called to the block at 1 Irving Place in Union Square just before 5pm. The deceased woman, whose identity has been withheld until police notify her family, was found by a building maintenance worker. Police do not yet know how she ended up in the trash compactor, but neighbors at the luxury apartment block told NBC they believed it was related to Weiners recent conviction for sexting an underage girl: Police say a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a luxury residential building in Manhattans Union Square. Crime scene investigators were on the scene at 1 Irving Place Tuesday evening, collecting evidence in the bizarre and grisly death. Police say its not clear yet how the 48-year-old woman died, but her body was found at around 5 p.m. Her purse was found near the trash chute where it appears she went in. Neighbors said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the buildings famous resident, Anthony Weiner. The disgraced former congressman is still listed as a resident at the building, though hes currently serving time in prison for sexting an underage girl. Security footage also shows the woman walking into the apartment building shortly before she was found inside the machine, PIX11 reported: A womans body was found inside of a trash compactor near Union Square on Tuesday, police said. Officers found the body at the Zeckendorf Towers on Irving Place just before 5 p.m., officials said. The woman, identified only as being 48 years old, was unconscious and unresponsive when police arrived on scene. Security camera shows the woman entering the building shortly before her body was found in the trash compactor, sources said. Property belonging to the woman, who entered the compactor area on the 27th floor, was found inside the compact room, police sources said. Police have not yet released her name. The circumstances around her death are not yet clear. According to Daily Mail, Weiner and Abedin have owned an apartment at the address for 16 years, which was listed for rent at $11,900 a month on the same day he pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl. Abedin also filed for divorce that same day. The listing, posted on May 19, 2017, was taken down just days later, though it is unclear as to whether the estranged couple found a renter, or if the property was taken off the market for other reasons. Their modern apartment, located on the 14th and 15th floors, has a view that overlooks Union Square Park and extends out over the midtown skyline. There are 670 units in the apartment block, divided into four blocks: Gramercy, Village, Park, and University. There is a communal pool, gym, and grassy rooftop for residents to enjoy. The former congressman, who is currently in prison, is eligible to begin his three years supervised release in August 2019. This is not the first time that someone connected to the Clintons has mysteriously died. It certainly will be interesting to see what they come up with in order to explain away what appears to be a murder at the apartment building where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner own a home.

Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump. Baios wife, Raylene, wasnt on the plane but was checked into St Timothys on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldnt be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was really special as Chachi and he sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge. Baio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento hes been sporting. Baio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasnt personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh: The President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once Chachi. He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet. To clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. Baios remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone.

Subsequent questions have emerged, however, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent is saying they are unaware of such a statement having ever been issued by the Syrian branch. They further say the Syrian Red Crescent was shut down in Douma effective April 7.  The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma. The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place. The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didnt seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they mightve been exposed to. (This has been retracted, it is incorrect.) Chemical attack or no, it wouldnt be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didnt get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy. The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning. With White Helmets claiming scores killed and over 500 wounded by exposure, it seems impossible to believe that if it was true no one can find any of these real patients to confirm an attack.", "title": "THIS ARTICLE RETRACTED: Red Crescent Says No Evidence of Chemical Attack in Syrias Douma", "label": "fake", "id": 622}
{"message": "The recently installed CEO of Donald Trumps presidential campaign was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couples southern California home. I was wondering when this would come up, Bannon told Politico. Its been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trumps campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while were on the subject, Im actually disappointed; I honestly didnt expect them to take this long, he said laughingly. Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that arent targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, its just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? Its so obvious I honestly find it hilarious. But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, Alright, look, thats the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things youre not supposed to in a relationship, thats the whole beauty of it. And just like theres no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as youre doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, Ill have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I dont mean that in everyday life. Im talking about when theyre performing their marital duties, he argued. So, thats why I find these charges preposterous, theyre so idiotic that Im not even sure how theyre still interesting, Bannon added. Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day. And when youre in love, everythings allowed, I dont care what anyone says, when you say the words I do, and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it? he concluded. source:politicops.com Comments comments", "title": "Stephen Bannon: Nobody Can Blame You For Beating Your Wife If Its Out Of Love", "label": "fake", "id": 623}

{"message": "The Bodybuilding community has long coveted the best performance-enhancing drug to boost muscle growth and improve energy levels. For starters, you have dbols, one of the most popular steroids today. It has also been said that this steroid can be found in muscle cells in as little as 6 hours after injection. Bodybuilders use this drug because it has an anabolic effect on muscle proteins. It speeds up protein synthesis and cures some minor health issues. This muscle catalyst is also known to promote the growth of new muscle tissue. However, its effects can last up to two weeks, making it a popular choice among bodybuilders. This steroid has also been shown to improve nitrogen balance and enhance recovery from training. It also provides an increase in lean body mass as well as bone density. Here is the list of the best performance-enhancing drugs for bodybuilding: Anabolic Drugs Or Steroids Anabolic drugs or steroids are involved in building and maintaining muscles. The steroid substances that promote muscle tissue growth are, in fact, precursors to basic hormones. The pituitary gland produces anabolic hormones. It is controlled by a hormone gland located at the base of the brain. These hormones control several functions such as; metabolism and protein synthesis. When you take this steroid, it will help you to gain muscle, strength, and stamina. This dbols supplement also plays an important role in building muscle and bones through stimulating protein. Beta-2 Agonists These synthetic drugs help expand the lungs capacity, which means more oxygen is forced into your bloodstream. This, in turn, will increase metabolism rates and build lean muscles. These drugs are used during training sessions and events where a bodybuilder will be working out. The Beta-2 Agonists allow the body to burn more carbohydrates, and at the same time, they help you to use fat as energy. It also provides great energy that helps to reduce fatigue, stress, and anxiety. Human Growth Hormone Also referred to as HGH, this drug has increased lean muscles. Human Growth Hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland responsible for growth during childhood. It remains active the whole life and can be stimulated by taking HGH. In addition, testosterone and other human growth hormone are factors that lead to building muscle. Athletes who take this drug have an increase in insulin which is also an indirect anabolic effect of HGH. Ephedrine Bodybuilders have used ephedrine for a long time. It has been around there for so long because of its ability to burn fat, boost metabolism, and enhance physical performance. Ephedrine is a popular drug for bodybuilders because it can be helpful while training and events to burn fat and increase muscles. Methenolone Methenolone is another popular steroid that is considered to be milder than most. Athletes use it for its potency in enhancing recovery time and prevention of injury. This steroid has also been used to increase muscle size and strength. It has the specialty of recovering the injury, whether external or internal. That is why athletes and sports people mostly consume it.", "title": "Historical blog about Seattle, as well as the state of affairs today.

{"message": "Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian Agents Anonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say. The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds  literally. This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name Alexi Jonesinov) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President. However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with. It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome. It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space. We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box, one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control peoples actions as Russian neuro-brain hacking. When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were ridiculous, outrageous and goofy. However, Peskov suspiciously asked vere is Moose and Squirrel? NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control peoples brains, hes never seen anything on this scale before. The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road. You are all nutsalmost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we dont matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands.

{"message": "Story highlights The crown prince arrived in New York before Trump was sworn into office The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates Washington CNN  Former national security adviser Susan Rice privately told House investigators that she unmasked the identities of senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York late last year, multiple sources told CNN. The New York meeting preceded a separate effort by the UAE to facilitate a back-channel communication between Russia and the incoming Trump White House. The crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, arrived in New York last December in the transition period before Trump was sworn into office for a meeting with several top Trump officials, including Michael Flynn, the presidents son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his top strategist Steve Bannon, sources said. The Obama administration felt misled by the United Arab Emirates, which had failed to mention that Zayed was coming to the United States even though its customary for foreign dignitaries to notify the US government about their travels, according to several sources familiar with the matter. Rice, who served as then-President Obamas national security adviser in his second term, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that she requested the names of the Americans mentioned in the classified report be revealed internally, a practice officials in both parties say is common. Rices previously undisclosed revelation in a classified setting shines new light on a practice that had come under sharp criticism from the committee chairman, California Rep. Devin Nunes, and President Donald Trump, who previously accused Rice of committing a crime. But her explanation appears to have satisfied some influential Republicans on the committee, undercutting both Nunes and Trump and raising new questions about whether any Trump associates tried to arrange back-channel discussions with the Russians. I didnt hear anything to believe that she did anything illegal, Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican helping to lead the panels Russia invesigation, told CNN of Rices testimony. He declined to discuss any of the contents of her classified remarks. Through a spokeswoman, Rice declined to comment about her testimony. Nunes refused to answer questions when asked about Rice Tuesday evening. Its unclear precisely which Trump officials Rice discussed at the House meeting. But multiple sources have confirmed to CNN that Zayed met at the time with Flynn, Kushner and Bannon. The three-hour discussion focused on a range of issues, including Iran, Yemen and the Mideast peace process, according to two sources who insisted that opening up a back-channel with Russia was not a topic of discussion. Still, the fact that the New York meeting occurred prior to the Seychelles session and that the UAE did not notify the Obama administration about why the crown prince was coming to the United States has raised questions in the eyes of investigators on Capitol Hill. A secret meeting in the Seychelles But the Trump Tower meeting came shortly before the UAE brokered a meeting to open lines of communications with the United States and Russia, with a clandestine January meeting in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, according to reports in CNN and The Washington Post. That meeting is now under investigation on Capitol Hill, though its unclear whether Rice mentioned the Seychelles meeting in the testimony. A senior Middle East official told CNN that the UAE did not mislead the Obama administration about the crown princes visit, but acknowledged not telling the US government about it in advance. The meeting, which took place December 15, 2016, the official said, was simply an effort to build a relationship with senior members of the Trump team who would be working in the administration to share assessments of the region. The meeting was about ascertaining the Trump teams view of the region and sharing the UAEs view of the region and what the US role should be, the official said. No one was coming in to sell anything or arrange anything. A spokesperson for the crown prince declined to comment. The Seychelles meeting  and the circumstances around it  has been a subject of interest to Hill investigators looking at any potential link between the Trump campaign and Russia. The Washington Post initially reported in April that the UAE brokered a pre-inauguration meeting between the founder of the security firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, who is a close Trump ally, and an associate of Vladimir Putins in the Seychelles Islands. The purpose of the meeting was part of an effort by the UAE to persuade Russia to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, according to the Post. And it occured shortly after Bannon, Flynn and Kushner also met in Trump Tower with Zayed, whom the Post said helped arrange the Seychelles meeting with Russia government officials to set up the private discussions with the Trump team. But the senior Middle East official told CNN this week that Princes name was not discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. And Prince himself has said he did nothing wrong, telling CNNs Erin Burnett last month: I was there for business. Both the White House and Prince have strongly denied that Prince was working as a liaison for the Trump administration. Prince said he met with a Russian while at the Seychelles but I dont remember his name. It probably lasted about, as long as one beer, he said about the meeting. Explaining unmasking For her part, Rice had been called to the House Intelligence Committee to testify partly over what Nunes and other Republicans believed was an abuse in the practice of unmasking  or revealing the identities of Americans who were communicating with foreign officials under surveillance by the US intelligence community. Simply unmasking the names of individuals in classified reports does not mean that their identities will be revealed publicly, and Rice denied to the committee that she leaked classified information to the press, sources familiar with the matter said. But Rices suggestion that she unmasked the names of US individuals  who turned out to be Trump associates  over concerns about the propriety of the crown princes visit to the United States could help her fend off attacks that she was out of line in the actions she took. Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican who is helping lead the House investigation, told the Daily Caller nothing that came up in her interview that led me to conclude that she improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates or leaked it to the press. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not say explicitly whether Trump still believes Rice committed a crime but added the issue of leaking and unmasking needs to be investigated. Weve seen illegal leaking of classified materials, including the identities of American citizens unmasked in intelligence reports, Sanders told CNN. Thats why the President called for Congress to investigate this matter and why the Department of Justice and Intelligence Community are doing all they can to stamp out this dangerous trend that undermines our national security. Nunes was forced to step aside from running the Russia investigation amid a House ethics inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified data. The ethics inquiry came in the aftermath of his bombshell comments that Obama administration officials had improperly unmasked the names of Trump associates, a revelation that Trump used as cover for his unsubstantiated claim that Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped during the election to spy on him. The Justice Department said in a court filing Friday that the DOJ and the FBI have no evidence to support Trumps claims. But on Tuesday, the Republican who took over the investigation from Nunes said there was no reason to bring Rice in for further questioning. She was a good witness, answered all our questions, Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican now running the House Russia probe, told CNN. Im not aware of any reason to bring her back.", "title": "Rice told investigators why she unmasked Trump aides", "label": "fake", "id": 630}
{"message": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression. According to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint. Police arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home. Responding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down. When the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as  Enyas Who Can Say. After attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house. The responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the homes basement. According to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basements concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains. William Provost, who police believe to be the groups ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers: I find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they dont, so I stick to what works for me. Upon searching the homes basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances. Police also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals. In addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift tool wall that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims. Upon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence. Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning. Though modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that Ive ever heard. Provosts accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officers that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012. As of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane. All three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.", "title": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression", "label": "fake", "id": 631}
{"message": "With the unthinkable now cautiously possible, peace between North and South Korea, speculation about President Donald Trump becoming a Nobel Peace Prize winner has begun. If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trumps candidacy. Recognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace. But, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trumps apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father wont get the credit. Remember who decides this stuff, he tweeted. ... The globalist elite would never give him that win. Getty Images Its not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine. Trump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With rocket man quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war. After the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,\" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.\" If that meeting and Fridays summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award. Were not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Graham said on Friday on Fox  and  Friends. Laura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday. When will we see the headline: Trump Ends the Korean War? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Ingraham said. If Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissingers acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because peace has not been really restored in South Vietnam. When the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize, he said. Other controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time. Former President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\" The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to depopulate Africa. There are currently 329 candidates for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, according to the organizations website.

The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be the perfect day to commit the attack because Pier 39 would be crowded with people. Media reports confirmed that Jameson had recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago. However, what those reports dont mention is that the would-be terrorist also liked numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement. Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms. He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including Trump Resistance Movement, Things Trump Supporters Say, US Democratic Socialists, Progressive Politics, and Jeremy Corbyn. Some of Jamesons favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages. The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, Islam  Religion of Peace and Stunning Hijabs, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages. Jamesons Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism. As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe. A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists. During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC. According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses.

Thanks to Medicaid hes being treated for cancer. During the CNN town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Kline explained his situation and his struggles. My question is pretty straightforward, Kline told Price. Why do you want to take away my Medicaid expansion? Prices dispassionate answer seemed to fall flat on the audience. I took care of a lot of patients with cancer, Price explained about his 20 years as an orthopedic surgeon. We dont want to take care away from anybody. What we want to make certain, though, is that every single American has access to the kind of coverage and care that they want for themselves. But, what if there are people out there who are going to die more quickly because of what youre doing here, because youre essentially taking medical care away from people who need it the most? Kline wouldnt back down. Are you saying you actually want people to be okay with that? Price thought for a second, then replied: Look, I understand how all of this sounds right now, but you know, there comes a time in everyones life when they just have to stop talking B.S. and be practical. As of right now, the fact to the matter is, our national budget is hemorrhaging money because of Obamacare. And believe me  I get how insensitive that sounds, but at the end of the day, we have to stop ignoring the facts here. He continued, I understand that this is not something anyone wants to hear, especially people whove got worse problems to deal with than the state of the national budget, but this is one of those situations where the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. When President Trump assumed office, he was appalled at the state of the national budget and our finances. It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that Barack Obama was to blame, since hes the one who left the hot potato behind for us to deal with. Now, Im not going to go into whether or not he did that on purpose, but at the end of the day, all I can say is, we have to fix the problem or else were looking at nationwide riots and another economic recession. Put simply, we have to plug some holes  of which, by the way, there are plenty  and we kind of have to start with the biggest ones, the orthopedic surgeon added. Unfortunately for millions of people across the country, Obamacare seems to be the biggest one by far. Besides, there are more ways than one to look at this picture. I know its not pretty, but at the end of the day, even people who are able to fight off cancer  Im sure you know what Im talking about, Brian  they cant lead 100 percent normal lives, ever again. What kind of an existence is that, to have to survive instead of live? At the risk of sounding insensitive, weve pretty much got two choices here: we either repeal Obamacare, or we take out more loans from countries like China. And nobody wants to be in debt to the Chinese. At the end of the day, its better for our national budget if cancer patients pass away more quickly, its a lousy way to live anyway, and Im sorry to say it out loud, but its the truth, Price concluded.", "title": "Tom Price: Its Better For Our Budget If Cancer Patients Die More Quickly", "label": "fake", "id": 637}

{"message": "INTRODUCTION Initial Officer Training Programme (IOTP) provides basic military officer training to Officer Cadets (OCdts) and their equivalents from law enforcement and uniformed services. The programme falls within the tactical level of the Professional Military Education (PME) framework of armed forces and is modelled from the Royal Military Academy Sandhursts (RMAS) Commissioning Course. It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff. Rationale Traditionally, the Jamaica Defence Forces (JDF) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries: United States, England, Canada, China and India. Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF, there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone. This is normally done at the Unit level and later, through a Young Officers Course. The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel, thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas. Additionally, the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants. Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula, IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations. The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course, through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus, is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world. Concept Having the RMAS approach to training at its core, IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training. The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership golden thread. The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate, build, develop and scrutinize an OCdts ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress. The expectation is that on commissioning, an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them. The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge, skills, attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment. Location The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) Newcastle, which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station, St Andrew, Jamaica. Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees, ferns, ground orchids, delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies, is the Newcastle Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm (later Field Marshall). Gomm, a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841, relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post. The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7, 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe. Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks, it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever. In Jamaica the British garrison was stationed on the plain at Up Park Camp, Stony Hill, Fort Augusta and Port Royal. Here, on the average, 1 soldier died every 2 days. According to Russell, the year 1838 was considered a good year: only 91 men died. In 1839, 110 men perished and in the following year 121. Initially, the British government was conservative in approving a hill station for the troops in Jamaica. They were concerned about the expense of the venture. In May 1841, London finally sanctioned Gomms efforts to build what is thought to be the first permanent mountain station in the British West Indies at Newcastle. The site selected was a coffee plantation protruding from the southern face of the grand ridge of the Blue Mountains. The British government paid 4,230 for the Newcastle site. At the outbreak of World War II (1939-1945), life at Newcastle changed a little. The British regiment was replaced by Canadian regiments which remained at Newcastle for the duration of the war. With hostilities over in 1945, the Canadians left and once again a British battalion was stationed there. In 1958, the West Indies Federation was founded and the infantry regiments of the various Caribbean islands were disbanded and reorganized into the West India Regiment. Newcastle became a training depot, training recruits from all over the West Indies as part of the newly formed West Indies Federation. In 1962 when Federation was disbanded, the West India Regiment was also disbanded. Jamaica simultaneously sought her independence, which was achieved on August 6, 1962. With independence, Newcastle was given to the Jamaican government as part of a general settlement of all military lands in Jamaica.", "title": "President Trump Underscores US-Jamaica Relations  Jamaica Information Service", "label": "fake", "id": 640}

{"message": "A major game-changing incident took place after the National Guard stormed the border to protect the immigration laws and defend citizens from having nearly 2,000 people break into America illegally. America is a land of laws and those wishing to immigrate to the country must follow the proper laws and protocol because people cannot simply walk in without following the rules. Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally. Out of those 1,600 its unknown how many people have criminal records, but they were all about to have a criminal record if they broke into a country illegally. The National Guard helped protect the border and provided the extra manpower that was needed to keep the situation under control. It was reported that the level of criminal activity has slowed due to the agents being present. The Washington Examiner provided this information about the border situation: U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border, CBP and defense officials said Wednesday. National Guard officials overseeing the border state deployments said troops helping monitor the international boundary have freed up more border agents to physically guard the border. The result has led to a surge in the amount of criminal activity agents have stopped. Trending: BUSTED!! Hillarys Strange Scarf Accidentally Slips Off In Public Exposes What Shes Been Hiding For Months! The increased surveillance and communication between guardsmen and border officers also led to CBP intercepting an additional 451 people who were turned back before illegally entering the U.S. Those numbers could tick up considerably if the 4,000 National Guard troops President Trump approved on April 4 are called on in a future request from CBP. As of Wednesday, 775 troops have been deployed and are on the ground providing direct support on the ground in seven sectors assisting law enforcement officers. Troops are providing support from the air, surveillance back-up, and assistance with infrastructure projects like vegetation clearing and road maintenance, not including to the border wall construction. Another task is to specifically free up agents to leave their desks and get back out to the field. The troops monitoring remote video surveillance systems have then been able to report sightings to a greater field of agents and thus, the number of apprehensions has increased, officials said. Those folks are giving us the additional situational awareness in the radio rooms  which are allowing the Border Patrol agents sitting in those areas to go into the field, said one National Guard official, who described the addition of the Guard as a force-multiplier for the CBP. As a reminder, these guardsmen are not carrying out law enforcement duties, an official representing the Texas National Guard said. Guardsmen have been deployed to the following Border Patrol sectors: 200 to the Rio Grande Valley, 120 to Laredo, 90 to Del Rio, 70 to Big Bend, 110 to El Paso, 135 to Tuscon, and 50 to Yuma. In late April, the California National Guard said 200 guardsmen were in training at Camp Roberts and would be deployed in early May. Around 55 troops are already working in those sectors. The deployment is funded through the end of fiscal year 2018, September 30. Ronald Vitiello, CBP deputy commissioner, said in April the intent of the mission is for CBP to regain operational control of the border. With the deployment being funded through to the end of the fiscal year of 2018, that means the law should likely be upheld for quite a while until its time to renew the budget or the illegal swarm backs off and follows the law. Some critics are upset that America wont simply allow people to break into the country, but borders exist for reasons and permit the land to adhere to their laws. Some people want borderless countries, but that would result in absolute chaos much like whats happening to Germany, Sweden, and London where they have been ravaged by refugees. Will you comment below and share this to your friends? Will you start a conversation about borders and the proper protocol that it takes to enter a country the legal way.

{"message": "Workers in New Orleans dismantled the citys Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years. As workers slung a strap around the statues waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags. This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments. The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama. It will be nice, Landrieu said, to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege. The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars. Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors. Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night. We would have preferred it to be in the daytime, Johnson said, so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything. Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators  both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included Wheres Mitch? while opponents chanted, Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.

{"message": "Washington, DC  A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazons best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama. Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book The Black House, reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off. In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well. Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge, Horner said. I saw many men coming and going from Obamas room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim. Berman: In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers? Horner: When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldnt wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed. Berman: Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various tortures that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain? Horner: Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit. Berman: Can you give us any insight on Obamas feelings towards the American people? Horner: He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as mongoloids and idiots. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant. Berman: What is one of the things readers will find the most shocking? Horner: Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obamas insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing Ive ever witnessed. Were talking 10-15 partners in a single day.

Theyre saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE! Scary! From HuffPo: A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent. In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trumps victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies. At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week. The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become faithless or conscientious electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention. The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamiltons Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nations highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures. Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.", "title": "BREAKING: PUTIN INTERFERENCE COULD GIVE COURTS LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT", "label": "fake", "id": 653}

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }} With only a month to go before the big day, Donald Trump and his team's attempts to find artists to perform at his inauguration ceremony are looking increasingly desperate. As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication. It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day. So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day. Here is who has declined so far: Elton John (AFP/Getty Images) (Getty) This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be \"the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration.\" That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: \"Incorrect. He will NOT be performing.\" John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: \"I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign. \"I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you.\" Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up Enjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up Andrea Bocelli (Getty) In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance. Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality. But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did. He wrote on Twitter: \"I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number.\" Celine Dion According to reports, Celine Dion didn't decline Trump because she didn't want to perform, but more because she was just too busy. Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans. John Legend has been vocal about the US election from the start. Asked for his opinion on why Trump was having so much difficulty in finding talent for the ceremony, he told the BBC: \"Creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate. \"We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him.\" Adam Lambert Adam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues. \"I don't think I would take money on that one,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.\" The Dixie Chicks Opposition to the Iraq War derailed the career of Texan threesome Dixie Chicks (Getty) Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. \"No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,\" he said. \"If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.\"", "title": "Donald Trump inauguration: Artists who won't perform at ceremony include Elton John, Celine Dion and John Legend", "label": "fake", "id": 657}

The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy. After a short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorneys custody.

{"message": "Leonardo DiCaprio has sailed on the Titanic, battled grizzly bears in the brutal Wild West, and explored dreams. Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says hes going to travel to Mars  but for real. Well, at least thats what he told President Barack Obama. DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprios new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood. The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody, Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to whats in our hearts. The reality of it is, if youre a human living on this planet  which most of us are, yeah? she joked. As long as we havent signed up for the trip to Mars. I dont want to know if anyone has, I think youre crazy. As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musks recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, I did. Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didnt actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in. I think hell acknowledge hes crazy, the president said with a smile. Its unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it. Its probably method acting, is what were saying. President Barack Obama, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change.

{"message": "Lady Gaga has opened up about the perils of fame. In an appearance on CBSs Sunday Morning, the Million Reasons singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. Im very acutely aware that once I cross that property line Im not free anymore, Gaga said. Its like Im stepping out into this entirely different world where everybodys allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I cant even call the police to help me because theyre not doing anything wrong, the singer complained. I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me Id have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off  weve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well. Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasnt her first choice, as well as that he couldnt have picked a worse time to become President of the United States, due to the fact that I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House. It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself. And I havent been able to do that in a long time, she revealed. So, Im sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but Im afraid Im going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever Im out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well, the singer revealed. At this point Im not sure whether thats going to be some aggressive type of makeup or a full-on mask thatll cover my face, but what I do know is thats the only thing I could think of to get at least some semblance of my privacy back other than visiting a plastic surgeon. Im too good looking to be changing my face at this age. Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybodys life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where Im able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, Ill be going back to wearing a mask. What can I say  I guess Ill need to put on an actual poker face for the time being, until things get back to normal, both in my private life and in the White House, Gaga concluded.", "title": "Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More", "label": "fake", "id": 662}

Original picture: President Trump Destroys Everyone at His Wild Press Conference in Trump Tower 8/15/17 Busted! Journos Rush To Spread Fake News Following Trumps Latest Press Conference Donald Trump gave a speech addressing the violence this past weekend in Charlottesville. During his speech, the President asked if the alt-left bore as much responsibility for the chaos as its extremist counterparts on the alt-right. Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him. Politicos White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as us in his speech. Just noticed the use of us in this transcript, wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet. Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us? she wrongly quoted the president as saying Speaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the alt-left (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts. In the speech, Trump clearly says Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at em? .@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for themtoday it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD  Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017 As Karnis tweet made the rounds on Twitter, someincluding CNNs Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. Transcript may be funky, he wrote. Others, like New York Times Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers. Haberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood. Despite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. Trump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters, wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet. The fake news stems from Politicos inaccurate transcription of Donald Trumps speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote. The updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction at the bottom.

{"message": "Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although shes desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears. Many have felt that Michelles behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyones attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that shed slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why. Michelles hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit thats only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with. Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obamas administration before Trump took office: Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husbands presidency? Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today. Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obamas recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away. Shes in legacy building mode. She doesnt have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come, Wright said. This is the time shes most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public. As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book. I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and thats been true over the last three administrations, she wrote. Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that shes now suffering a feeling of hopelessness with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. Its ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on. The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of. Dean James from Americas Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country shes more than profited off of: So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected. Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your husband has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black. The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.", "title": "Michelle Obama Just Received LIFE-SHATTERING News From The Doctor", "label": "fake", "id": 668}

{"message": "The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States. Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board. Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds. When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit. According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant. Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation. According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer. Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.", "title": "New Regulation Requires 75 MPH Governor On All Motorcycles", "label": "fake", "id": 670}
