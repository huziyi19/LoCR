Still, Kelleys exit changes the original setup of the reboot, in which the story of the feud between the Carringtons and the Colbys was to be told primarily through the perspectives of two women at odds: Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies), daughter of billionaire Blake Carrington (Grant Show), and her soon-to-be stepmother, Cristal (Kelley), a Hispanic woman marrying into this WASP family and Americas most powerful class. the CW Cristal was a version of the Krystle Jennings character in the original series, played by Linda Evans, which was considered a female lead. It also was the case on the CWs Dynasty, whose Season 1 key art featured Gillies, Kelley and Show. The dynamic on the show already changed with the introduction of Nicollette Sheridan as Alexis Carrington late in Season 1.

{"message": "Nick Kroll's pants did a comedy bit of their own on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday night. The 40-year-old comedian sat down with host Kimmel to discuss his new film, Uncle Drew -- where he plays the self-identified \"token white guy\" in the comedy, which also stars NBA players Kyrie Irving, Nate Robinson, Reggie Miller, Chris Webber and Shaquille ONeal. While recounting getting the chance to play hoops with Irving, Kroll's pants split right down the middle. \"I got to play basketball against him. You don't think I'd hold up well against Kyrie?\" he asked the laughing crowd. \"I was literally like, 'I know I'm not in the NBA, but, you know, I was pretty good on my Jewish day school team.' I was like, 'I'm going to hold my own.'\" Kroll then recalled playing some decent defense and even scoring a layup on Irving, but his cockiness didn't last long  neither in the story he was telling nor on the stage with Kimmel. \"So now I'm cocky, I'm going back on defense and I'm like, 'I got Kyrie. I got Kyrie.' I'm hitting the ground and then,\" Kroll started, bending over to act out a motion before suddenly announcing, \"I just fully split my pants!\" The giggling crowd and Kimmel both had a laugh at Kroll's expense, while the comedian turned it into a joke of its own. \"Wouldn't it have been amazing if there was a full-on poop stain?\" he quipped. \"So, basically I did the physical equivalent of splitting my pants playing defense against Kyrie.\" Kroll continued his self-deprecating humor following the show on Instagram. \"And thanks to my stylist @jeanneyangstyle not only for the pants that split but for sending me these beautiful pics taken right after they split on #jimmykimmel,\" Kroll wrote alongside photo collage of his split pants. ET recently caught up with Kroll and he gushed about working with the NBA legends in Uncle Drew, hitting theaters on June 28. \"It just was one of those jobs where I was like, 'This is all I could ever ask for,'\" he said. \"I feel very lucky in general have the jobs I get to do. But this one in particular felt like what a fun combination of things.\" Kroll also talked about watching Irving transform into an older version of himself for the movie. \"I have a picture of Kyrie -- were in the parking lot. We're all in our little trailers getting ready to go to set and so he's got the makeup on,\" he recalled. \"He hadn't got into his wardrobe and, like, his belly.

She screams bloody murder and I smile because she is so wildly alive.\" In sharing news of her daughter's birth, Burton's message to other women trying to get pregnant is to stay hopeful. \"Now that folks know she's here, I don't want her birth to cause any other woman to weep at her kitchen table.

{"message": "Melanie Mel B Brown and husband Stephen Belafonte seem to have settled some of the issues in their contentious divorce ahead of their trial, set to begin Nov. 13. The couple, who are ending their marriage after 10 years wed, reached an agreement in the domestic violence portion of their divorce, TMZ reports  with the former Spice Girl agreeing to drop the temporary restraining order she filed in April against Belafonte. Brown, 42, had accused her ex of physically and emotionally abusing her, alleging in her TRO filing that she was in fear for her life and that Belafontes alleged abuse ramped up when her career was on an upswing. Belafonte, 42, and Brown  who wed in Las Vegas in June 2007  also settled a portion of their property division, TMZ reports. A rep for Brown did not immediately return PEOPLEs request for comment. Phillip Faraone/Getty The former couples divorce has been a nasty battle since Brown filed in March and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Brown also requested to terminate the courts ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafontes behalf.) Amid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nannys relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion. She was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved. RELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel Bs Restraining Order Against Her Ex Meanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafontes marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout much to most of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets. Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage, Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Browns allegations, claiming they are nothing more than a smear campaign. Also in court in October, Browns lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were of a sexual nature, according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Browns legal team, said 90 percent of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Browns consent. Belafontes lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were consensual.

Greys Anatomy fans may still be mourning the loss of their beloved Dr. Derek McDreamy Shepherd after he was killed off last April, but Patrick Dempsey, the actor who played him for 11 seasons, was ready to move on. Im very grateful for Greys Anatomy, Dempsey tells PEOPLE exclusively in this weeks issue. Its given me the opportunity to do everything. But at the same time, there was a cost. Indeed, long hours and an enormous time commitment began to take a toll on the 50-year-old actor, who also struggled spending so much time away from his wife Jillian and their three children: Talula, 14, and 8-year-old twin boys, Darby and Sullivan. I think after a certain period of time, no matter how much money you make, you want control out of your own schedule, says Dempsey, who stars in Bridget Joness Baby, out Sept. 16. It had been long enough. It was time for me to move on with other things and other interests. I probably should have moved on a couple of years earlier. I stayed a bit longer than I should have.

But we kept it very quiet. With no table reads, the actor says no one knew how his character would perish. I knew he was going to be gone, but I didnt know how she was going to handle it. Shonda just said, Im going to do it in a really good way and she did her thing. In the end, I thought it was really interesting, says Dempsey of McDreamys death. It definitely woke people up.

Earlier this year, the couple weathered what Cena described as \"a point of disagreement,\" and during a February visit to TODAY, he said that, for a while, \"It seemed we couldn't get past it.\" And a teaser for Season 3 of \"Total Bellas\"  the reality TV show Bella shares with twin Brie  showed the couple in tears, questioning whether they \"really want to call this off.\" \"I think in relationships, you have highs and lows, and that was an extreme low,'' Cena told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb. \"You have two choices. You either jump ship and start a new relationship or move forward and try to work through it.\" He added that they both had work to do but, at that time, they hadn't \"jumped ship yet.\"", "title": "WWE stars John Cena and Nikki Bella split after 6 years together", "label": "real", "id": 7062, "evidence": []}

I believe that life is about doing, Hawn explained to Hudson in a conversation for Interview magazine, after being asked the million-dollar question. Its about changing. Its about transitioning.

The pair's \"Morning Joe\" pal  and our very own Sunday TODAY anchor  Willie Geist wasn't able to attend (due to some \"very early morning television\" the next day), but he spoke about the wedding on the show Monday. \"Joe and Mika are off today and this week. Why, you ask? They had a very busy weekend,\" he stated early in the broadcast, before sharing a few details with viewers. \"Joe and Mika were surrounded by all of their children, which made it very special for them.\" In addition to Scarborough's four kids and her two, all from previous marriages, family from both sides and a small group of close friends gathered together to witness their union. The couple exchanged vows at the National Archives. Miller Hawkins \"We wanted it to be really small and simple and not what you expected from Mika and Joe,\" the bride, who wore a white midi-length dress covered in a sheer polka-dot lace, told Vanity Fair Saturday. \"Everything we do is exposed, and everything felt exposed every step of the way, so we want this to be private until its over. We wanted to recognize it more quietly and have the people who are most important to us around us.\" Keeping the guest list short was just one way they assured the event would remain a secret ahead of time. They shared with the publication that the invitations were extended via phone calls rather than hard copies, the reservations were made under the name of a friend and the Thanksgiving weekend date was selected for the rare hubbub-free time it brings to Washington. Scarborough added, \"We made the decision a year ago to dramatically change our lives and have a low-key existence. The more time we can spend with our family, the happier we are.\" And they were clearly happy on Saturday  as were those in attendance. Scarborough's former House colleague, Rep.

{"message": "The boyfriend of Los Angeles police officer-turned-reality-TV attorney Loredana Nesci was sentenced Tuesday to 16 years to life for her murder, Los Angeles County prosecutors said. Nesci, the star of SundanceTVs Loredana, Esq., was killed in 2015 inside the Redondo Beach home she shared with Robert Reagan, 53. She was 47. The news of her death destroyed our life and we will never be the same, said her father, John Nesci, in a statement read during Reagans sentencing in Torrance Superior Court. All of a sudden, in the dark of the night, everything was stolen from her and from all of us. Advertisement Nesci was an avid body builder whose show followed her life as a tough, hardworking attorney in the Riviera Village. Her young son, Rocco, was featured in several episodes. A statement written for the sentencing by Robert Nesci, the victims brother, described a troubled relationship between the couple  one that Nesci was allegedly preparing to leave. She wasted years of her life, gifted you with so much money, and foolishly believed in your stories, he wrote. Reagan was distraught when he called police to the home in 2015 to report an emergency, said Redondo police Sgt. Fabian Saucedo. It was kind of weird actually. He didnt say anything. Its one of those things we call an unknown trouble call, Saucedo said at the time. It was very vague, like, Whats going on? Police automatically respond to 911 calls, so they drove by Nescis home  where Reagan waited outside, Saucedo said. Advertisement He gave them details of what may have occurred, and as a result, [the officers] decided they better go in and check the welfare. Thats where they found the body, Saucedo said at the time. Obviously it was some kind of domestic dispute; otherwise, it wouldnt have led to this. After police discovered Nescis body, Reagan was arrested. His defense attorney contended in court that the stabbing was in self-defense and that Nesci fell on the knife during a struggle. An autopsy revealed that Nesci was stabbed at least four times in the abdomen between her breasts and belly button. Reagan waited more than five hours after the stabbing to call police, contacting an attorney first. A native of Connecticut, Nesci joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1996 and worked as a patrol officer in the Southwest Division, according to a biography on her website. An LAPD spokeswoman declined to confirm that Nesci was a former employee, citing privacy issues. Nesci said she was among the officers present during the North Hollywood shootout in 1997. Her career with the LAPD was brief. She left the department in 1998 and enrolled in law school at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. In 2004, she returned to California and melded her legal career with pursuits in entertainment and media, including hosting a radio show on KCAA-AM (1050). esmeralda.bermudez@latimes.com @LATBermudez", "title": "Boyfriend of slain reality TV star Loredana Nesci sentenced to 16 years to life", "label": "real", "id": 7092, "evidence": ["A top Los Angeles Police Department official is accused of stalking as he used a tracking device to monitor the movements of a subordinate with whom he had a romantic relationship, according to a", "The Los Angeles Police Protective League is seeking to force the city to request a judge intervene in the publication of the photos in order to protect the identities of undercover officers and", "By Libor Jany Staff Writer.

{"message": "Jenelle Evans -- star of \"Teen Mom 2\" -- recently held a birthday party for her son, Jace, but one person who was left off the guest list was her mother, and Jace's primary custodian, Barbara Evans. Earlier this week, Barbara held a birthday party for Jace and didn't invite Jenelle, which the reality TV star said really hurt her son's feelings. The now 8-year-old has been stuck in the middle of a bitter custody battle between Jenelle and her mother since she gave up custody of him as a 17-year-old. The young mother was ill-prepared to care for him, but feels that she should have him back now, though the courts, unfortunately, don't agree. Rival birthday parties for Jace The women have been using Jace as a pawn to act out their resentment for one another, and his 8th birthday party was, unfortunately, no different. Barbara threw Jace what appeared to be a Hulk-themed birthday party at a children's center. Jace attends school near Barbara, and several of his friends were photographed smiling as he sat on a Hulk throne with several young boys grinning. The young boy is rather subdued when he does appear on \"Teen Mom 2\" and appears no different in the photos. Jenelle maintains that she tries to keep the fights with her mother away from Jace, but viewers of the show know that this is not the case. The mother of three is often fighting with Barbara in front of her son, and sometimes even refuses to appear on camera. However, Jenelle has stated that she wants both women to have equal footing in his life, despite the fact that her actions seem to point to the contrary. Barbara not invited to her wedding, either Although Jenelle claims that Jace was hurt over the fact that his mother was not invited to the birthday party his grandmother threw for him, Jenelle decided not to invite Barbara to her own wedding. She claims it is because she won't \"give Jace back,\" but unfortunately for Barbara, it isn't necessarily an easy thing to do. Jace has been living with Barbara for the majority of his life and is settled into school and Scouting activities where Barbara lives. The court decided that Jenelle should legally have time with her son, but have not yet agreed that she is entitled to primary custody. This has, no doubt, enraged Jenelle, who feels that this is all Barb's fault. So, for now, the pair will continue to feud over Jace, giving him dual birthday parties as a way to snip at one another.

She also said that they have a \"no gifts\" policy to keep themselves and their children grounded. It's great that these two are finding a balance that works for them. Advertisement Advertisement Kim Kardashian and Kanye West may be one of the most famous couples on the planet, but even they know that sometimes keeping things low-key is best. Kardashian told Allure magazine that she and her husband have a strict \"no gifts\" policy in order to keep herself, West, and their children as grounded as possible. We dont do gifts,\" she told them. \"[Kanye and I] talk about it all the time, about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible. I dont like presents anymore.\" Kardashian also revealed something that every busy couple can relate to  she and Kanye didn't do anything special for their anniversary. Well, unless you count IHOP. Advertisement Advertisement We just did absolutely nothing. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept, she told Allure. You know what? I think we went to IHOP. Thats what we did. This couple is keeping things as low-key as they can. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images As someone who once spent a \"vacation\" with my boyfriend eating Cheesecake Factory cheesecake in bed, I totally approve of the West's anniversary plan. The Wests' new stance on gift giving is a surprising one, given that they've gone viral for giant flower walls and custom Birkan bags, but it makes sense given their relatively low-profile since Kim's horrific Paris robbery. Obviously everyone enjoys a good gift, but even the Allure profile piece notes that Kim is gifted countless things out of the blue every day and she said she doesn't feel the need to have so many things around anymore. Instead she's focusing on the little things  like the treasure chest her daughter North gave her to keep her safe when she went to Paris. Advertisement Advertisement To have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry, she told them. It seems like the Wests have realized that valuing quality time instead of material things is a love language that they prefer, which is something that's important for every couple to find out for themselves.

{"message": "To say Shia LaBeoufs latest film has had an uneventful theatrical run would be an understatement. The actors Man Down, a drama about a U.S. Marine returning home from war, had a limited release in U.S. theaters in December that ultimately made less than half a million dollars domestically after opening to mostly poor reviews. But that domestic total practically qualifies as blockbuster status compared to how the film was received on the other side of the pond. The movie, which also stars Kate Mara and Jai Courtney, opened an extremely limited run in just one U.K. theater by selling just a single ticket in its debut, according to several reports. The Hollywood Reporter added on Wednesday that the film eventually improved on that total by selling another pair of tickets at that same theater in the U.K. town of Burnley, bringing Man Downs total box office grosses in the country to-date to just three ticket sales. Considering that the local theaters owner told The Hollywood Reporter that she doesnt expect to sell any more tickets for the film, Man Down could end its theatrical run in the country this week with only about $26 in sales. The movie was distributed by an arm of Lionsgate. To be fair to LaBeouf, the actor has appeared in a number of high-grossing movies during a Hollywood career that already spans more than two decades. Topping that list would be LaBeoufs lead roles in three films from Paramounts Transformers franchisethree movies that grossed a total of nearly $2.7 billion worldwide between 2007-2011. Its fair to say that LaBeouf is at a stage in his career where he tends to opt for roles in more small-budget, independent moviesthough he also had a supporting role in the 2014 World War II drama Fury, opposite Brad Pitt. Fury grossed $211 million at the global box office. Last year, LaBeouf starred in the coming-of-age drama American Honey, released by independent studio A24. The movie was very well-received by critics but went on to earn just $1.8 million at the box office, including roughly $570,000 in the U.K., according to Box Office Mojo. Get Data Sheet, Fortunes technology newsletter. Meanwhile, Man Down is far from the only recent film with high-profile stars to see its U.K. box office sales barely register as a blip. Box Office Mojos tracking data for movie ticket sales across the U.K., Ireland, and Malta shows that a drama starring Richard Gere and Dakota Fanning called The Benefactor grossed only $35 in those regions last year.

{"message": "This post contains spoilers for This Is Us Season 2, Episode 14, Super Bowl Sunday. As promised, This Is Us finally revealed the full story of Jacks death, starting with Jack waking up to the smell of smoke. By the time he stirred, the Crock-Pot fire fans saw begin last week had consumed the house. But it wasnt the fire itself that killed Jacka detail that makes his death all the more devastating. Last episode, fans watched Jack live out his last day, right up until the moment the camera ominously loomed on the family Crock-Potas it set the kitchen ablaze. The slow cooker, fans learned, had been a gift from the family who previously owned the houseand its notoriously tricky switch appeared to be what would ultimately lead to Jacks demise. Well, that and the Pearsons smoke detector, which we already knew had no batteries inside it. Still, it was unclear how exactly Jack died in the house fire. The clues had been floating around for months, but now they finally came together to form one gut-wrenching episode. This week, once he realized the house was on fire, Jack gathered Rebecca, Randall, and Kate (Kevin was not home the night of the fire). He lowered the kids and Rebecca to the ground from the second floorwhich is when their dog, Louie, began barking. Kate screamed for the dog, but he didnt come out on his own. Bent on saving their pet, Jack went back in the house, successfully saving Louie, as well as a few of the familys prized possessions: a photo album and a copy of Kates audition tape to music school. You are something else, Rebecca said as they sat together in an ambulance, along with a concerned paramedic. Jacks response? A typically humble I try. Paramedics wanted Jack to get to a hospital, concerned about the amount of smoke hed inhaled, but he and Rebecca wanted to drop the kids off at Miguel's first. The doctor proclaimed Jacks minor swelling to be a miracle, and despite appearing a little absentminded, Jack was in good humor and seemed fine. Unfortunately, as Rebecca booked a hotel, spoke to the kids on the waiting-room phone, and picked out a snack from the vending machine, Jack died of cardiac arrest. Kate blames herself, we learned, because of all the things Jack retrieved for herbecause, as she put it, he couldnt bear to disappoint me. Its been a bit disconcerting to watch NBC turn Jacks demise into a TV event in the same vein as deaths on more gruesome showslike The Walking Dead, which has faced accusations of manipulative storytelling in recent seasons. To some, this might undercut the NBC dramas reputation for sweetness and empathya series about family of good, relatable people trying their best throughout difficult circumstances. Whatever some might think of the shows chosen setup, however, it delivered exactly what it promised: one hell of a post-Super Bowl tearjerker.", "title": "This Is Us: Why Jacks Death Was Even More Haunting Than Fans Expected", "label": "real", "id": 7111, "evidence": ["Broadcast Networks 2022: The Year Everyone Started To Wave The White Flag.

{"message": "The CWs new Charmed reboot has its fair share of critics  but Shannen Doherty is not among them. Doherty, who played Prue Halliwell in three of the original dramas eight seasons, stood behind the new version during a Q and A at Comic-Con Paris. I have seen a lot of people be very mean and very negative and cruel to the new show and the new cast, Doherty began, after the mere mention of The CWs reboot drew boos from the crowd. I want to remind everybody that these are three girls who just want to act. They got a huge opportunity, and I would implore everybody to be a little bit kinder. Doherty went on to speak about the reboots positive, good influence, adding that this is a show about three strong women again I know that it may not be your Charmed, but you should all really pat yourselves on the back and congratulate yourselves, because youre the most loyal, amazing fans in the world. And because of you, you made it a show that a younger generation wants to see. TV Reboots: Original Stars Weigh In View Gallery 10 Images She continued: You have to think about what Charmed did for you when it was on and think about what thats going to do for a new generation. Embrace it, you guys. Its doing well, ratings-wise, and its employing over 200 people. (Having dipped both weeks since its launch, Charmed is thus far averaging 1.33 million total viewers and a 0.42 demo rating, ranking fifth and fourth among all CW shows.) Doherty has had kind words for the Charmed reboot since it was first announced. She came to the projects defense back in January, saying that she was intrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted. Original Charmed star Holly Marie Combs, meanwhile, has been critical of the new version from the start. After The CW placed a pilot order for the reboot, she tweeted that Charmed belongs to the four of us, our vast amount of writers, crews and predominantly the fans. You will not fool them by owning a title/stamp. So bye. Update: Similarly, fellow original cast member Alyssa Milano has called the reboot a hurtful situation, saying, Its hard for us to see something that we loved so dearly then be taken from us in a way that had absolutely nothing to do with anything that we had done and created. [T]he only reason why the show is able to have a reboot is because of the relationships we created.

Pal Tamra Judge was there to help her through the milestone  physically and emotionally. I have never taken this off, except when I was pregnant and my fingers were too fat and it wouldnt fit anymore, Shannon said, as the two struggled to remove it from her finger.

Cohan, who has starred on the apocalyptic AMC series since its second season, has been tapped to lead a new ABC comedy called Whiskey Cavalier, which has already received a full season order. A report by Collider suggested that Lincoln, too, would only appear in the first six episodes of season 9, suggesting that perhaps things will come to a head.

Lennie James, who plays Morgan, left the series to play a crossover role in spin-off series Fear the Walking Dead, which is about to air its season 4 midseason finale.

I wish I could take credit for that, but I cant, really, said the proud dad. Thats really all her.

I tried to imagine the things Id want her to read that would help her understand men and sex and partnership better, and at that moment, I realized a strange thing, wrote the Magic Mike star. I dont want her looking to the outside world for answers. My highest hope for her is just that she has the fearlessness to always be her authentic self, no matter what she thinks men want her to be. I guess if theres one thing that I think men wish women knew, its just that they alone are enough, added Tatum, who announced his split from Dewan in April after nine years of marriage.

{"message": "The woman whose sexual assault accusations against Bill Cosby led to the entertainers guilty conviction last month is breaking her silence after 13 years. Speaking publicly for the first time outside of a courtroom, Andrea Constand shared details about the night Cosby assaulted her during an exclusive interview with NBCs Kate Snow for a special edition of \"Dateline.\" The events of that one night led a Pennsylvania jury to find Cosby, 80, guilty of three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Constand was operations manager for Temple University womens basketball program in 2004 when Cosby, a famous Temple alumni and supporter, invited her to his home. Constand had been contemplating a career change and Cosby, who had been mentoring her for months, said he wanted to discuss her plans. Constant said Cosby offered her something to help her relax that night. Three blue pills. And he put his hand out and I said, What are those? And he said, They'll help you relax,'\" she recalled. \"And I said, Are they natural? Are they, like, a herbal remedy? And he said, No, they're your friends. Just put them down. Constand said she ended up taking the pills because Cosby was the one who gave them to her. I trusted that they would maybe just help me feel a little more relaxed, she said. But within half an hour, she started slurring her words and could no longer walk. As she testified in court, Constand said Cosby helped her to a couch and then assaulted her. My mind is saying, Move your hands. Kick. Can you do anything? I don't want this. Why is this person doing this? And me not being able to react in any specific way, she said. So I was limp. I was a limp noodle. Constand said she drifted in and out of consciousness. I was crying out inside, in my throat, in my mind, for this to stop. And I couldn't do anything, she said. Andrea Constand recalls details about the night she was assaulted by Cosby, while sitting next to her mother, Gianna Constand. Dateline NBC Constand awoke hours later, embarrassed by what had happened. She said Cosby gave her some breakfast  tea and a muffin  and Constand drove herself home. She took a shower, had a good cry and went on to work. But she didn't tell anyone about the assault until a year later when she opened up to her mother. Constand said she feared that no one would believe what had happened to her  that the renowned actor, whose fame skyrocketed as Dr. Huxtable, the goofy pediatrician he portrayed on the popular sitcom, The Cosby Show, had just assaulted her. More than a dozen years later, Constand's claims were the basis of a criminal trial in 2017 ended with a hung jury. A retrial earlier this year resulted in a guilty verdict.

Meanwhile, performers like Terry Crews have opened up the conversation to discuss sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry at large. In a post entitled In light of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, actress Lili Reinhart joins them in revealing her own experience with workplace sexual harassment, which began when a former co-worker attempted to sexually assault her on a date.

I was a teenager working on a project  when I started to have a crush on a guy I was working with, Reinhart begins on her Tumblr, explaining that her co-worker was a significantly older man who asked out the Riverdale star. Im not comfortable giving specific details about the situation because I dont feel its necessary, she says. All that matters is that he tried to force himself on me when we were on a date.

Phillippe and his team had told Hewitt and her lawyer that he would produce all texts with Reese but they keep missing their own deadlines. Hewitts attorneys say they have given Phillippe and his legal team multiple extensions to hand over the documents they requested.

Hewitt wants the court to sanction Ryan Phillippe for not turning over the text messages to the tune of $12,640 and for the court to order the actor to turn over all documents she has requested. As The Blast first reported, Hewitt sued the actor for $1 million accusing him of assaulting her at his Los Angeles home. She claimed after an argument with the actor, she went to his house to get her belongings. Once she arrived, she claimed Phillippe was extremely agitated, grabbed her upper arm so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm and then braced his body and violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.

The conversation came to a head last week when two young girls were told they would not be able to board a United Airlines flight because they were wearing leggings. And the issue of whether or not to wear sneakers, though not likely to set off a viral news story, still tends to polarize. Leave it to frequent flyer Miranda Kerr, though, to override the debate with a look that combined the comfort of a legging and the elegance of a heel in one fell swoop. Kerr touched down at Los Angeles International airport today in a tonal look that started from the ground up. She wore stirrup spandex boots by Balenciaga, a legging-like silhouette that extends from hip to toe for a smooth, seamless finish. The effect was a stylish step up from the stretchy sportswear that were used to seeing at the airportand everywhere else, for that matter. Kerr tucked a slim navy top into an Alaa miniskirt in the same shade. While a pencil skirt would have been impractical for travel, her fit-and-flare silhouette offered a more movement-friendly alternative that felt just as feminine.

{"message": "Ever since The Wedding Singer, fans have been praying for Blended stars Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler to get together and carry each other around when their arthritis is bad. Now, however, it's clear that the most we can hope for is an on-screen romance. Not only did Sandler fail to relinquish the remote in Click, but there is no evidence that he did dishes in the kitchen sink or put Barrymore to bed when she'd had too much to drink. The only way they can grow old together, it seems, is by continuing to make romantic films until the flesh falls from their bones. Chelsea Handler recently conducted an interview with the two stars, and while they were holding hands on set, they mostly dished about staying with their families in South Africa and closing their windows to avoid monkey attacks. (Barrymore is currently married to Will Kopelman, while Sandler is spoused up with Jackie Sandler). When Handler asked them if they'd ever dated, the response was a firm negative. The two Blended stars almost stumbled over themselves explaining how they avoided the great honeypot that is co-starring in a romantic film with another attractive human being. (See Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Twilight, and That 70's Show for the opposite results.) Barrymore asserts that there was, \"Not even like, as we say in The Wedding Singer, 'church tongue,'\" while Sandler adds, \"We always hung out, always had a good time.\" Apparently, their platonic friendship is the recipe for prolonged romantic filmmaking together, as emotional baggage is nowhere in sight.

{"message": "Frontline Entertainment Management is taking Criminal Minds actor Thomas Gibson to court over money allegedly owed to the firms Craig Dorfman. According to a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Dorfman has represented Gibson since 1996  through five different publicists, three business managers and three talent agencies. The two are said to have met when Gibson was acting on Chicago Hope, and Dorfman, first representing Gibson as a talent agent, says he convinced Gibson to audition for Dharma  and  Greg. The only constant in GIbsons life and career has been Dorfman, and now Gibson has decided to burn Dorfman as well, and not pay him for his years of work, states the lawsuit (read here). The lawsuit attempts to burn Gibson right back with the revelation that he makes $200,000 per episode for CBS Criminal Minds and word that hes known as Captain Vanilla among industry professionals thanks to his lack of professionalism. Dorfman claims credit for doing stuff like cajoling network execs and angry producers after Gibson sparred with co-workers and making up excuses for last-minute cancellations of press tours. The manager says he picked the actor up from jail one time after being arrested for drunk driving and defended his client after the sending [of] lewd videos and messages to a stranger he met online. Its all setup to the primary allegation that Gibson has breached an agreement by failing to pay 10 percent of his salary to Dorfman, not only for Criminal Minds but for such independent films as Come Away Home, Berkeley and Ill Believe You. The contract is said to be an oral one, agreed to in January 2003. The end of the relationship between the two is described as coming after Gibson demanded earlier this year that the commissions be reduced to 7.5 percent, and when Dorfman refused, he was terminated. The plaintiffs are now seeking at least $480,000 in damages. The lawsuit was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.

{"message": "Why Is It Airing Now? According to the executive producer, Terry Wrong, Fox dug up this interview to satisfy the huge demand for more O.J.-related television. The former network executive Preston Beckman  known on Twitter as the Masked Scheduler  noted in a blog post that Fox probably intentionally showed it on Sunday night to counterprogram ABCs premiere of the revived American Idol. (They probably dont want egg on their face if AI returns with an impressive number, he said.) In interviews leading up to the broadcast, both Ms. OBrien and Mr. Wrong stressed that Mr. Simpson didnt get a dime for this special. He was reportedly paid $800,000 for the book If I Did It in 2006, but got no money for the interview then, according to Fox. Fox, on the other hand, definitely stands to benefit  which was one of the complaints levied before the broadcast was scrapped the first time. Fox, Ms. Regan, Ms. OBrien and Mr. Darden have all insisted that The Lost Confession is a vital document in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. The special was framed as a look inside the mind of a domestic abuser, and perhaps a warning to any woman who might be in a relationship with someone who talks the way Mr. Simpson does in the interview. Mr. Wrong also made sure to point out that unlike in 2006, the Brown and Goldman families gave their blessing to show this footage, ostensibly because they believe it makes Mr. Simpson look guilty. Does O.J. Come Clean? It certainly seemed that way. Bear in mind that this interview has been edited down from about four hours (according to Ms. Regan, in promos Fox sent to TV critics), and that throughout Mr. Simpson is referring to the hypothetical confession in the book If I Did It. In the six minutes in which he talks about the murders, he describes being on the scene with a friend named Charlie  whom the panel believes was just a voice inside his head. Its all very odd. That said, when Mr. Simpson describes grabbing a knife (I do remember that part, he says), and recalls seeing copious amounts of blood, it doesnt sound all that hypothetical. The interview goes on to cover the aftermath of the crime  including the infamous Bronco chase  and Ms. Regans questioning about what was going through Mr. Simpsons mind at that time keeps steering him toward explaining his feelings of anger, frustration, depression and yes, guilt. [ALSO READ: The O.J. Simpson Murder Trial, as Covered by the Times] The Lost Confession also offers a glimpse into its subjects character.

{"message": "Kenya Moore will definitely not be returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta for season 11 as a new report reveals more details about her exit from the show. Page Six is the latest and perhaps most notable media outlet to now confirm Kenyas departure from RHOA, as their report confirms earlier reports from other media outlets that Bravo fired her from her full-time role but gave her the opportunity to return to the show for its upcoming season  in a part-time role. [Producers] offered her [a] part-time [role] and she didnt want the reduction in pay. So shes out, an insider told Page Six on July 11. Blogger Tamara Tattles is also confirming the same thing, stating Kenya was unwilling to sign a contract for a part-time role and that Bravo refused to budge. Due to this, the July 9 deadline that Bravo gave Kenya to sign her contract for a smaller role on the show came and went, and it is now a done deal that Kenya will not appear on RHOAs upcoming season in any capacity. Kenyas hostility with RHOAs producers began after she secretly eloped and married her husband Marc Daly without informing Bravo. Since then, Kenyas husband has been hesitant to film for the show, only appearing in one scene last season, which led to producers being frustrated. Tamara adds that Marlo Hampton and Shamari DeVoe are currently in the running to replace Kenya, while earlier reports confirmed Eva Marcille will be Sheree Whitfields replacement for season 11. If you recall, Sheree was fired immediately following last season. At the end of last month, the cast of RHOA assembled in Miami for a filming session at the opening of NeNe Leakes boutique without Kenya. A short time later, Kenya said she hadnt been fired and claimed to be reviewing [her] latest offer. She also suggested she and husband Marc were getting their own show. In the past, Kenya was quick to shoot down these reports but she is staying mum this time, instead posting new photos of her baby bump just moments ago. Kenya began appearing on the Bravo TV reality series during its fifth season and married Marc just before season 10. Then, at the end of season 10 earlier this year, Kenya confirmed she and Marc were expecting their first child together. Photo Credit: Shutterstock", "title": "Its Official!

{"message": "Updated with Nerdist statement: Chris Hardwick, the Nerdist founder and host of NBCs game show The Wall, AMCs Talking Dead aftershow and a regular emcee in Hall H at Comic-Con, has been scrubbed from the Nerdist website he founded after being accused of sexual abuse and long-term abuse by his former girlfriend Chloe Dykstra. Legendary Entertainment, which owns Nerdist Industries where Hardwick launched his career as a comic and podcaster, just released a statement. Chris Hardwick had no operational involvement with Nerdist for the two years preceding the expiration of his contract in December 2017, it reads. He no longer has any affiliation with Legendary Digital Networks. The company has removed all reference to Mr. Hardwick even as the original Founder of Nerdist pending further investigation. Repeating the Legendary statement, Nerdist itself also address the matter online: The moves come after Dykstra, a TV personality and host, penned a first-person account of their three-year relationship that posted on Medium. Dykstra never mentioned Hardwick by name, but details about the mildly successful podcaster who grew into a powerhouse CEO of his own company suggest she was referring to him. Dykstra, in an essay she said was part closure and part warning, detailed a relationship in which she was restricted from going out at night, having male friends or speaking in public places and was the victim of sexual assault. I was expected to be ready for him when he came home from work, she writes. I lost myself, both mentally and physically. I lost 15 lbs within weeks, started pulling out my hair (and had to get extensions regularly to hide it), she wrote. I generally stopped speaking unless spoken to while with him, drifting through life like a ghost. I would try to sleep in as late as possible so my days were shorter. I stopped listening to music entirely. I ceased to be. I was an ex-person. Dykstra said she left Hardwick after three years, and that after the breakup he made calls to companies to get me fired by threatening to never work with them, and that he and a female colleague steamrolled my career. Deadline has not independently confirmed Dykstras accusations. In March, NBC renewed its Hardwick-hosted game show The Wall for a 20-episode third season, though no premiere date was announced. AMC also just announced his summer bridge talk show Talking With Chris Hardwick returns this Sunday. On Thursday, BBC America announced that Hardwick would moderate the networks Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con in San Diego next month.

Pitt bid six figures to watch a Game of Thrones episode with Clarke on Saturday night during a silent auction at Sean Penns annual gala for Haiti, held at Milk Studios in Los Angeles, California. During the charity gala, the auctioneer announced the opportunity to watch an episode with Clarke, who was in attendance at the A-list event, along with her Game of Thrones co-star Kit Harington, though the cast members were seated at separate tables. The auction to watch the episode with Clarke started at $20,000, but the race quickly escalated. At one point, the auctioneer yelled out Is the King of the North here?! But as it turned out, Harington had stepped out of the gala to go to the restroom. Meanwhile, Pitt bid $80,000 to watch an episode of GOT with Clarke. Then he outbid himself to $90,000. When Harington came back into the room, the actor offered to also sit in on the episode viewing. And thats when Pitt raised his own bid to $120,000. In the end, Pitt was outbid by a gala-goer who ended the auction at $160,000. The charity event to benefit the J/P HRO  and  Disaster Relief Organizations was hosted by Penn, CAAs Bryan Lourd and Sean and Alexandra Parker. Also in attendance were Amazons Jeff Bezos Lena Dunham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Segel, Connie Britton, Patricia Arquette, Mark Burnett, Roma Downey and Leonardo DiCaprio, who was honored for his work combating climate change. The biggest challenge now is to make sure that everyone understands whats at stake, DiCaprio said of the dangers of climate change during his speech onstage at the gala. Referring to President Donald Trump, DiCaprio continued, But how can we do this when we have a president who, just this week, proposed a massive increase in offshore drilling? Garnering laughter from the room, DiCaprio quipped, Their denial of so much of the scientific proof and evidence belongs in the Earth is flat chapter of human history. During his speech, DiCaprio applauded Penn for being a role model with his philanthropic work with Haiti. By the midway point of the gala, more than $3 million had been raised to support the efforts in Haiti, though the fundraising continued throughout the night toward what will amount to a larger number in the millions. These are obviously incredibly turbulent and scary times, DiCaprio said during his speech. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, its the only thing that has. Later during the auction, DiCaprio bid $80,000 on a painting by artist Josh Smith, but was outbid by Clarke herself for $90,000  but, there was a second Smith painting available, so in the end, both DiCaprio and Clarke ended up walking away with artwork.", "title": "Brad Pitt Bid $120,000 to Watch Game of Thrones With Emilia Clarke", "label": "real", "id": 7264, "evidence": ["Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, began as an online bookstore and has since evolved into a global technology giant, transforming how we shop, read, and consume media.; Its meteoric rise to", "Founded by formerly married couple Jeff Bezos and Mackenzie Scott in 1994, Amazon started as an idea for a simple mail-order business for books.

{"message": "Our September cover story, A Life in Bold, a portrait of actress Angelina Jolie by contributing editor Evgenia Peretz, has been the subject of some controversy, specifically the paragraph that follows, which describes the casting of Cambodian children in Jolies upcoming film, First They Killed My Father: To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time, Jolie says. When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back. Jolie then tears up. When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didnt have enough money for a nice funeral. Some reporters and readers raised concerns about the casting process. Jolie responded in a statement, saying the audition had been taken out of context, and added she was upset that a pretend exercise in an improvisation . . . had been written about as if it was a real scenario. She also stated the suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened. On August 1, Jolies lawyer contacted V.F., saying Peretz had mistakenly reported the incident, and asked us to run a statement, excerpts of which follow: The casting crew showed the children the camera and sound recording material, explaining to them that they were going to be asked to act out a part. . . . The children were not tricked as some have suggested. . . . All of the children auditioning were made aware of the fictional aspect of the exercise and were tended to at all times by relatives or guardians from NGOs. . . . We apologize for any misunderstanding. Jolies lawyer also asked us to remove the original paragraph from the online version of Peretzs story and to publish the above statement prominently, with the title Angelina Jolie Correction in the October edition of V.F. and also on VF.com.

In a post on Twitter Saturday, Osteen said he was praying for those affected by the storm, which has dumped 20 to 40 inches of rain on the Houston area, with more on the way. But on Sunday, in response to requests that the church, which can hold more than 16,000 people, be opened for evacuees, Lakewood Church posted on Facebook that it is \"inaccessible due to severe flooding\" and directed displaced residents to shelters in the city. The Facebook post courted criticism on social media, where photos appeared to suggest that the massive building, which was once home to the NBA's Houston Rockets, had not been damaged by the torrential rains. It's unclear if the church was damaged in the storm. In response, Osteen insisted in a statement Monday evening that he and his church are \"prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity.\" \"We have never closed our doors. We will continue to be a distribution center for those in need,\" the statement reads. It adds, \"Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm in helping our fellow citizens rebuild their lives.\" Lakewood Church sent photos that it says show flooding in and around the building.

Of course he said it, Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That. Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated. President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history, Bush said. This has hit a raw nerve in me. In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last years presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent. Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how you can do anything to women when youre a star. He said he was able to grab them by the pussy. After the recordings release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as locker room banter. More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times. Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tapes release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trumps, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than hypothetical hot air from Americas highest-rated bloviator. There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act, Bush wrote. His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.

The actress died after 12 p.m. on Friday at the Franciscan St. James Health Olympia Fields hospital just outside of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reported. Browns cause of death was not immediately disclosed. On Chicago Fire, Brown played the witty and pragmatic Connie, the assistant to Chief Boden, and appeared on the show since it began in 2012. The Chicago Fire family is devastated to lose one of its own, Dick Wolf, the shows executive producer, said in a statement. Our thoughts and prayers are with DuShons family and we will all miss her. In a 2016 interview with the Huffington Post, Brown described the cast and crew of Chicago Fire as a family. Im not on set every day, but people are always asking me about my kid and how my day is going and they are all so very sweet and kind, she said. Recently, the actress told Hidden Remote that Connie, her character on the show, wasnt supposed to be a series regular initially. When auditioning for the role, she said, she realized the one-liner role could develop into something more. The character then became more complex and served as sort of a mother figure, Brown said. Theyve done this beautiful dance with Connie where you see her soft moments, you see how she cares about the kids in the firehouse, Brown said. Brown had a similar experience during her 13-episode stint on AMCs Prison Break, where her character, initially just called Nurse, developed into a larger role, later named Katie Welch. She appeared on that show from 2005 to 2007. Throughout her career, Brown also appeared in a number of other TV shows and films, including Shameless and Empire. When not in front of the camera, Brown worked as a crisis counselor at Kenwood Academy High School in Chicago and led its drama program, according to the Tribune. Growing up, Brown attended Whitney Young Magnet High School in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in psychology. She is survived by her daughter, Zoe. We are devastated by the loss of a very talented and kindhearted soul, Robert Shroeder, Browns manager at Grossman  and  Jack Talent in Chicago told the Tribune.

{"message": "With so many classic TV shows being revived--from Roseanne to Murphy Brown to 24--many fans have wondered if Buffy the Vampire Slayer would ever return, whether as a reboot or a revival. As it turns out, though, they aren't the only ones. Speaking at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem (via Variety), Fox TV group chair Gary Newman says Buffy is always on the studio's mind. \"I think if you look in our library, Buffy is probably the most ripe show we have for bringing back,\" he says. Still, just because the studio wants to do it doesn't mean it'll go ahead and give the green light without the approval of creator Joss Whedon. \"It's something we talk about frequently, and Joss Whedon is really one of the greatest creators we ever worked with. When Joss decides it's time, we'll do it,\" Newman explains. \"And until Joss decides it's time, it won't happen.\" How big a role Whedon would play in any sort of revival or reboot is anyone's guess, but it's reassuring to know that the studio wouldn't move forward with it unless he signed on. Of course, given that Whedon recently left his role as writer and director of a potential Batgirl movie, perhaps a return to the small screen is in his future. Why wait for a Buffy reboot or a revival with the original cast, though? Technically the story didn't conclude with the end of the series.

Confidential, and Pearce suggests in a new interview with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton that Spacey got inappropriate with him during production. Spacey has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by serval men, including Star Trek: Discovery and Rent actor Anthony Rapp. During the interview, Pearce was asked about Spaceys history of abuse and working with the actor early in their careers. Pearce did not want to reveal too much about his experiences with Spacey, but he did imply nonprofessional behavior when he said, Yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor, incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. Pearce followed the comment with the following remark, Hes a handsy guy. Thankfully I was 29, and not 14. According to Yahoo Entertainment, Dentons audience could be heard gasping at Pearces revelation. Pearces implication would not be the first time a high profile actor has come forward to reveal Spaceys behavior on set. Gabriel Byrne said last December that Spaceys sexually inappropriate behavior stopped production on The Usual Suspects. The films director, Bryan Singer, refuted the claim. I did not know honestly then the extent of his violence, Byrne told The Sunday Times. I mean, he was kind of a joke in that people would say, Thats Kevin, but nobody really understood the depth of his predations. It was only years later that we began to understand that [filming] was closed down for a particular reason and that was because of inappropriate sexual behavior by Spacey. In the months since the first allegation against Spacey was made, the actor has remained entirely out of the spotlight.

On Monday, the 25-year-old singer attended the 3rd annual InStyle Awards in Los Angeles, where she turned heads in an adorable little black dress, gold hoops, and smudgy purple eye makeup. And though Gomez kept things simple up top, the bottom half of her body was a completely different story. For shoes, the Fetish singer wore mismatched heels. On her right foot, Gomez sported a strappy sandal with a bright yellow ball as the heel, while the singers left foot was elevated by a trapezoid-shaped wooden box. And though the shoes complement each other with similar childrens blocks-shaped heels, they are far from identical. As unconventional as Gomezs heels were, she wasnt the first to sport them. In early October, three weeks ago, Emily Ratajkowski wore the exact same pair when she was attending a party for Paris Fashion Week. However, instead of Gomezs LBD, the supermodel opted to go lighter with an oversized white shirtdress. She also kept the mismatched theme going with different dangly earrings. On one ear, Ratajkowski sported a gold square, while the other flaunted a silver circle. Of course, both women looked equally incredible, and likely inspired legions of fans to mismatch their shoe collection as well.

{"message": "There are many reasons to love Leslie Jones: her love for tweeting about the Olympics and Game of Thrones, her acting in hilarious sketches on Saturday Night Live, and her unabashed support for women of all shapes and sizes. The comedian showed off the latter, along with her flair for the dramatic, last night at the Time 100 Gala in an epic tribute to another Jones: Grace Jones, iconic supermodel known for envelope-pushing androgynous looks. Wearing a show-stopping white double-breasted tuxedo dress with a high hemline and even higher shoulder pads, Jones completed the transformation with black cat-eye sunglasses, navy lipstick, and the supermodel's signature flattop haircut. The dress was a custom look created by Christian Siriano, who was one of the event's honorees. Siriano and Jones formed a close working relationship after the SNL cast member tweeted that no designers would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters. Less than one day later, Siriano reached out and the duo began creating a custom, red, off-the-shoulder ballgown with major Vivian from Pretty Woman vibes. \"It takes a real designer to design for a real woman,\" Jones said at the time, adding, \"I feel amazing. Christian hooked me up! Christian Siriano hooked me up.\" Jones seemed to know that her splashy tribute would be a hit. After the event, she took to Instagram to post her look. \"So did I pull it off or what??,\" she captioned a picture. \"'Pull up to the Bumper' bitches!! #gracejonesismyidol.\" She also posted a hilarious picture with Siriano at the event. \"Ok this was my favorite pic of the night!!

{"message": "In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie separated in September 2016. Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied. The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, tumbling through three national parks, and a music video. But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the self-inflicted situation hes in. But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly ripped apart the Internet has sided with him. An article titled Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword published on E! said, Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what hes gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what hes doing to right the ship. Vanity Fair said, Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that hes doing a lot of work on himself. And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery. The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval, on the interview. But of course the timing is calculated, Borkowski continues. The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.

This year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war, says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units.

It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the 60s or 70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.

{"message": "Mindy Kaling knows a little something-something about romantic comedies. As the creator of The Mindy Project, she had those of us who love a good rom-com covered. The \"will they or won't they\" aspect, the anticipation. The idea that a person can be best friends with the person they're meant to be with for years before finally falling in love. I suspect there might be a reason Kaling knows so much about romance and comedy. It's because she's living a full on rom-com in real life. For evidence, please grab a snack and study Kaling and B.J. Novak's latest Twitter exchange about Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. It's basically a rom-com in the making, and the most adorable thing I've seen other than the actual Cookie Monster himself. As Kaling's fans probably already know, the two self-described \"best friends\" first met on the set of The Office when they played sparring couple Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard. While the two briefly dated for a time, according to PopSugar, they have since been pretty clear that they are not romantically involved. They promise, they're not dating. Despite the fact that Kaling once described their friendship to TIME as \"romantically charged with loud arguments.\" Despite the fact that Novak shared this sweet message when his friend starred in A Wrinkle In Time in March, telling her how proud he was of her and reportedly moving her to tears with the gesture, as noted by Us Weekly. Despite all of this, they say they're just friends. OK... I guess this means we are only in the middle part of this particular rom-com, so we should just enjoy it. Which I'm sure fans will, especially if Kaling and Novak are going to be as adorable as they were on Twitter on Wednesday. Apparently the two got into something of an argument about whether or not Cookie Monster might have a wife. Novak wrote that he thinks Cookie Monster does indeed have a wife, while Kaling pointed out (wisely, in my opinion) that he couldn't possibly have a wife since \"his focus is entirely on cookies.\" So here is what I'm wondering: Are the two friends watching Sesame Street together with Kaling's 11-month-old daughter Katherine? Is that why they are thinking about Cookie Monster? Whatever the reason for the debate, fans hilariously weighed in. One fan pointed out that her husband is hugely focused on cookies... and he responded. Others offered evidence that Cookie Monster probably does have a wife, citing the recent addition of vegetables to his diet and the lyrics to the classic song \"C Is For Cookie.\" After much debate, Novak shared a page from Street Gang by Michael Davis that does, indeed, reference Cookie Monster's wife. Just in passing, though. As fascinating and important as this debate might be, the real draw here is the chemistry between Novak and Kaling.

According to the American Dermatology Association, dirty brushes collect product residue, dirt, and oil, making them a breeding ground for bacteria that can wreak havoc on your skin. Gross! But thats all the proof we need to say it's crucial to know how to clean makeup brushes, how often to do so, and when it's time to just throw them the heck out. We sweep our faces with these brushes almost every day, but we can't always say the same thing about how frequently we clean them. For starters, giving them a thorough washing every month or so is not enough. According to dermatologists and makeup artists, we should be sudsing up our tools far more often to prevent bacteria buildup, which can lead to breakouts. \"At least a few times a year I'm able to track down a new breakout to a patient's old makeup.

Legendary makeup artist Bobbi Brown is even more conservative, choosing to wash her brushes once per week. Because these brushes are used on your face, the cleaner they are the better, she says.

The 24-year-old was arrested on two counts of production of child pornography. If convicted, he could land in prison for a minimum of 15 years. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Jones will remain in federal custody until his court hearing Wednesday because prosecutors say he is a risk to the community and theres a danger hell flee. Court documents state that Jones was allegedly in communication with two underage female victims via Facebook in August 2016 and May 2017, and in both interactions, had asked the 14- and 15-year-old victims to prove to him that they were his biggest fans by sending him sexually explicit videos. In the criminal complaint, one girl admitted that she made 15 videos for Jones as recently as May 4th, in what she called an audition. She alleged that the YouTube star pressured her to work really hard even though she told him she might pass out and was tired from what he was asking her to do. At one point during the Facebook interactions, the victim allegedly acknowledged that Jones was 24, and he requested that she repeatedly acknowledge that she was only 14. Jones other alleged victim, whom he chatted with in August 2016, alleged that the singer told her she would get to perform a sex act on him if she were lucky. In the chat, Jones allegedly acknowledged that he was 23 at the time and the victim was 14. Federal authorities said the girl sent Jones a total of 25 videos, including eight that were sexually explicit. According to the complaint, once arrested Monday, Jones admitted to receiving videos from the victims, and he admitted it was for sexual pleasure. Jones, who is best known for his own renditions of popular songs by artists like Justin Bieber, Twenty One Pilots and Fall Out Boy, has a following of more than 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube page and more than 300,000 followers on Instagram.

Zac Efron may have been blessed with undeniably good genetics, but make no mistake: The lean physique he showcases in Baywatch has been earned. The average preparation time for Hollywood training usually lands somewhere around four to six weeks, but Efron started the work eight months before the cameras were on.

On top of that, I never once heard him groan about doing another rep. Patricks training was confusing at first, Efron says. He pushed me to my limits with a very multifaceted style: strength, explosiveness, fast-paced, calculated, diverse, and gut-wrenching workouts. It was fun  you never know what hes going to throw at you the next day. In terms of nutrition, he follows a strict diet, including several nine day detox cures in which sugar and carbohydrates are off limits, to be replaced by as many organic vegetables and lean proteins as he likes. 12 weeks of training later, the result is a sharply toned silhouette with rock hard abs and pecs and little over 5% body fat  the average is somewhere between 15% and 30%.

The royal couple were photographed sharing a kiss as they reunited for another tour, according to reports. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived at the region separately. Camilla returned from a private holiday, while Charles flew in on a RAF Voyager flight. It was a rare moment for the pair, who have only been spotted kissing in public twice: at a polo match in 2005 and before their marriage at a Somerset House reception in 2001. They are touring the region at the request of the Government. The trip serves as an important event leading up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London next year. After being welcomed by a ceremony of military pomp and pageantry, Charles and Camilla paid their respects to the fallen victims of Singapore's war. They headed to the Cenotaph memorial where they observed a minute's silence with other dignitaries, serving personnel and military veterans. Charles offered a wreath with the blooms shaped into the Prince of Wales' feathers.

In at least one instance, Prince procured an opiate prescription in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s, according to investigators. Prince was found dead in the elevator of his home in Chanhassen, Minn., on April 21, 2016, by Mr. Johnson and others after he ingested the fatal amount of fentanyl, which is often used to manufacture counterfeit pills that are sold on the black market as oxycodone and other pain relievers.

Hey, theres a reason she was accepted into every college she applied to this year!

Shes really taught me how to demonstrate that I have an opinion, especially when it comes to beauty, Shahidi, whos teaming up with Clean  and  Clear for the launch of its Acne Triple Clear Bubble Foam Cleanser, told PeopleStyle.

Knowing when to take it off. As Ive entered my teenage years, skincare is so important, so I feel confident in who I am, Shahidi said. I cant just wash my face and go to bed now. Its about making sure my pores are clean, getting all of the makeup out and making sure that my skin is hydrated. Her essentials: makeup wipes, a hydrating cleanser and face oil. Simple enough, right? I adore the Clean  and  Clear makeup wipes because amidst all the traveling I do, I dont always have time to [fully] wash my face. Ive also been playing around with the brands bubble cleanser because its gentle on my skin and gets everything out of my pores, the actress told us. After, I love putting on rosehip oil [as face moisturizer], which is so great for hydration.

{"message": "On Wednesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors approved new standards of conduct for members amid the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein revelations. A memo was sent out that night, as shown through screenshots posted to the web by journalists. On behalf of the Governors, I want to thank the specially formed task force, led by Governor and Academy Officer David Rubin, whose members dedicated many hours of research and discussion to drafting this document and evaluating future steps, Academy CEO Dawn Hudson wrote in the letter. According to the new guidelines, members must also behave ethically by upholding the Academys values of respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity. The Academy asks that members embrace their responsibility to affirm these principles and act when these principles are violated. There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency. The Academy is categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion, or nationality. The Board of Governors believes that these standards are essential to the Academys mission and reflective of our values. Should any member violate these standards or compromise the integrity of the Academy, as determined by the board, the Board of Governors may take any disciplinary action permitted by the Academys Bylaws, including suspension or expulsion. Weinstein, the now former head of The Weinstein Company, was stripped of his Academy membership when decades of sexual misconduct claims against him came to light from droves of women throughout the industry. Weinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex, but the Board of Governors determined the conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents. The scandal sparked a revolution with numerous other individuals coming forward with claims against directors Brett Ratner and James Toback, actors Kevin Spacey and Jeffrey Tambor, former Amazon Studios head Roy Price, former WME agent Adam Venit, and others. Much remains to be done, Hudson added in her memo. The task force will finalize procedures for handling allegations of misconduct, assuring that we can address them fairly and expeditiously. This process will ultimately guide the Board of Governors in assessing if certain allegations warrant action regarding membership. Those procedures will be sent to you in the new year.", "title": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "label": "real", "id": 7439, "evidence": ["He came forward preemptively after being contacted by Variety and The Hollywood Reporter about claims of sexual misconduct made against him by a former employee he worked with 30 years ago. \"This", "After Singer was ousted ahead of 2006's X-Men: The Last Stand, Ratner, 54, took over in his place.Multiple individuals — including Olivia Munn and Elliot Page — came forward in 2017", "Romijn, 50, starred as the blue-skinned Mystique in the \"X-Men\" movies, notably helmed by Bryan Singer and Brett Ratner.

The multi-talented MC opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a bang, bringing out high-profile guests Lil Wayne (No Frauds), David Guetta (Light My Body Up) and Jason Derulo (Swalla) for a four-song medley that concluded with a solo run through her recent single Regret In Your Tears. After an introduction that included snippets of previous hits like Beez in the Trap, Starships and Moment For Life, Minaj ripped into a forceful rendition of her much-discussed Remy Ma diss track No Frauds, with Weezy on hand to run through his verse. Drake, who is also featured on the song, did not appear (though he watched from the crowd), but Minaj had plenty more guests to come, moving seamlessly into Light My Body Up with Guetta manning the boards behind her.

{"message": "Super Bowl viewers were shocked when Netflix dropped an ad for The Cloverfield Paradox, revealing that the J.J. Abrams-produced movie heretofore known as God Particle would forgo a theatrical release and instead debut on the streaming service immediately following the big game on Sunday. The marketing stunt capped a rescue plan hatched by Abrams, Paramount chairman-CEO Jim Gianopulos, Netflix chief Ted Sarandos and head of original films Scott Stuber, among others. Worried that Cloverfield Paradox would perish at the box office  it was set to hit theaters April 20 after several delays  Paramount and Abrams handed it to Netflix, which is willing to shell out big bucks for high-profile content. The deal, broached over the holidays and finalized in January, is worth north of $50 million, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter, with Paramount retaining rights for China and home entertainment. It makes the movie instantly profitable for the studio, which avoids a (likely) misfire and costly marketing campaign. And Netflix got what it was looking for, regardless of withering reviews (18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes at press time): buzz. It gets them attention and captures some viewing right off the bat, says eMarketers Paul Verna. And even if the streamer doesnt ultimately get the viewership it hoped for Paradox, they still got a brand jolt, he adds. Cloverfield Paradox, which finished principal photography in September 2016, was part of the successful and popular Cloverfield series, but sources say Gianopulos, who joined Paramount six months later, was worried. Despite additions to clarify character beats and tie the film to the franchises universe, it was ultimately deemed unsalvageable, even with a cast led by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Elizabeth Debicki, David Oyelowo and Daniel Bruhl. Netflix was an obvious destination, having already taken over international rights to the Natalie Portman starrer Annihilation, which Paramount will release domestically Feb. 23. Paramount retains the rights to future Cloverfield installments. Overlord, a World War II zombie film from Abrams that scored high in two recent test screenings, could be a contender, although sources say that its fate is still undetermined.

{"message": "Miley Cyrus has evolved since her Hannah Montana days, but she can look back with a smile. While celebrating the release of her latest single Malibu, the 24-year-old pop star stopped by Radio Disney on Thursday, and she was surprised when the magical folks at the station pulled up some throwback footage of her audition tape for the Disney channel eleven years ago. You all are going to freak out, Miley said of her audition tape. By the way, my T-shirt says I should have my own TV show. That is so funny. That is crazy. That is a jewel. That is a gem. The first time I was ever in this building, which I drove to from Nashville with my momI had to sign in at the desk right there and tell them, Im here for an audition,' Miley remembered. For four seasons, Miley played the titular character on Hannah Montana, an ordinary girl by day and a famous singer by night, from 2006 to 2011. I auditioned with a song that I had written (with a friend of my dads) called Were Going to the Beach. And it was about being in Nashville and leaving to go to the beach. And that (the beach) being a paradise and a home thats the paradise to live. When you want to take a break you go to the beach and all your worries are gone, she continued. Now promoting this new song Malibu, that coming from Nashville I never would have imagined living in Malibu at this time in my life or by the ocean because I grew up on a farm. And now its just sort of ironic that these two songs are from the same person, just (almost) fifteen years later, the former Disney Channel star explained. Miley, whose last album was Miley Cyrus  and  Her Dead Petz in 2015, previously told Billboard that Malibu was partly inspired by her rekindled romance with fianc Liam Hemsworth, whom she lives with in Malibu, California. Its been an exciting and busy week for Miley who released her first song after a long hiatus. She will be performing Malibu for the first time this Saturday at 102.7 KIISFMs Wango Tango, and the singer will head to Las Vegas later this month to sing the single at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. While her music career will continue to take her all over the world, Miley considers her animal haven in Malibu as home. I have two pigs, seven dogs, two little horses and three cats so I cant live without having land and space and animals around me, she said during her interview in Radio Disney. Its kind of like bringing Nashville out to LA so that I can be able to work and be able to be in California where I can keep making music, but also feel like Im back home too at the same time.

Old white men, enjoy your last run. We are all fucking done with you lizards, Denbo wrote last week. Denbos story is similar to one shared by Maggie Gyllenhaal in an interview with TheWrap in 2015. Gyllenhaal described having been, at the age of 37, deemed too old to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. There are things that are really disappointing about being an actress in Hollywood that surprise me all the time, she said.

The longtime star of the Bravo hit has announced she will not return for the 11th season of the show, which will likely begin filming later this year. The 54-year-old released a statement about her decision to depart on Wednesday, which comes before the series' current season, its 10th, finishes airing. The cast has completed filming, however, having taped the reunion special earlier this month. \"After six seasons on Bravos [Real Housewives of New York City], I have decided to return to what I do best  journalism and producing, Carole writes. I am sure this does not come as a surprise to any of the viewers, all of whom have been supportive, encouraging, and kind.

The duo has been locked in a fight over growing pains in their friendship since the season premiere, though its never been made totally clear what their fight is about exactly. Im thrilled to leave frenemies behind, Carole notes in her statement, seemingly a nod to Bethenny. The timing of Caroles exit announcement is somewhat poetic, as she once joked that the summer of 2018 would be her last great summer. The former ABC news producer and author, who has penned both a memoir and a novel, joined RHONY in its fifth season after a major cast overhaul, which saw the exits of original stars Jill Zarin and Alex McCord. At the time, Carole wasnt the typical Housewife, a young widow who came from the world of hard news. My original curiosity about reality television has waned over the years,\" Caroles statement continues. I am focusing on TV and writing projects that better suit my more steady temperament. I have worked with amazing producers, made great friends  I will remember this entire experience with delight, humor, and a veracious accuracy. Next. Carole appeared to further address her exit on Instagram, sharing a post that simply said, \"Didn't change, just learned,\" which might be a response to unsupportive viewers.  A post shared by Carole Radziwill (@caroleradziwill) on Jul 25, 2018 at 12:48pm PDT Bravo has not revealed if any other cast changes will be made ahead of RHONYs 11th season.

You have to go through this to understand. (Although I hope you never do.) I am sorry for what happened,\" he added. Scroll down for more  Listen to Alec's phone message here... The actor has been banned by a court from seeing his 11-year-old daughter, Ireland, after unleashing a string of insults at her on the telephone. Baldwin was furious when Ireland - who lives with her mother Kim Basinger in Los Angeles - did not answer the phone when she knew he was due to call from New York. During the call, recorded on the girl's answering machine, Baldwin, 49, ranted: \"You are a rude, thoughtless little pig. You don't have the brains or the decency as a human being. \"I don't give a damn that you're 12 years old, or 11 years old, or that you're a child, or that your mother is a thoughtless pain in the ass who doesn't care about what you do as far as I'm concerned. \"Once again I have made an ass of myself trying to get to a phone. You have humiliated me for the last time with this phone.\" He then threatened to fly to LA \"for the day, just to straighten you out on this issue\". Baldwin, calling on April 11 at 10.30am New York time (7.30am in California), told Ireland he drops everything when it is time for his scheduled phone calls and expects her to do the same. The message had been contained in a sealed court file in the former couple's three-year custody fight over the girl, who lives with her mother in Los Angeles. Baldwin's attorneys filed papers asking the court to investigate the source of the leak, saying Basinger was \"the only parent with custody, possession and control of the minor child's telephone voicemail message\". Basinger's attorney didn't respond to requests for comment. Her Hollywood representative said only, \"The voicemail speaks for itself\".

By then, it was too late to save her ovary, which had to be surgically removed. \"I've had two kids, and it still wasn't at that level of pain,\" Anne Wheaton told TODAY in June. \"The surgeon (later) told my husband that this is the worst pain a woman can go through.\" A flipped ovary, more formally known as an \"ovarian torsion,\" can cut off a connecting artery's blood flow and lead to the the death of the organ. Wheaton, a children's book author, said that she believes the loss of her ovary might have been avoided if a female doctor, more in tune with that type of pain, had seen her in time.

{"message": "This piece was updated after publication with more information. In an unexpected last-minute shift, Lionsgate has dropped the John Travolta project Gotti just 10 days before its release. Gotti, a biopic about infamous mobster John Gotti, was sold back to its producers Tuesday, Entertainment Weekly reported. Production company Emmett/Furla/Oasis is expected to seek new distribution, but the movie is unlikely to make its December 15 release date. Former Entourage cast member Kevin Connolly directed the mob drama, and the project also features Travoltas wife Kelly Preston as Victoria Gotti. While the reasons for the sale remain unclear, this isnt the first obstacle Gotti has encountered throughout its production. A number of actors have been connected to the project throughout its years of development, including Al Pacino, Lindsay Lohan, and Anthony Hopkins. The film began production in July 2016. Update: On Wednesday, John Travolta, Kevin Connolly, and the producers of Gotti spoke out against reports that Lionsgate dropped the film. According to a new report from Deadline, Travolta persuaded Lionsgate to sell back the film in order to give it a wider release. All these reports are saying the studio dropped Gotti and John Travolta, thats 100 percent false, said Keya Morgan, executive producer of the film, via Vulture. The studio never dropped it! Lionsgate said, We want this movie. It has Oscar buzz. We had to beg them for it. Travolta reportedly shopped around for distributors who would give the film a larger release than the minimal plans that Lionsgate had for the biopic. That is the simple explanation for this, Travolta said. It wasnt dropped. It wasnt easy to get Lionsgate to give it up. They said no, twice, and I literally begged them to reconsider and they finally and generously let it go. Morgan vehemently denied claims that Gottis delayed release might be for any reason other than an attempt at a wider opening. This has nothing to do with any sex scandal at all, he said.

Marty was willing to reconcile with Danielle, but after the last few weeks he knew there was no turning back, an insider close to Caffrey tells PEOPLE. In a statement to PEOPLE on Thursday, her rep said, Danielle has not received any filing, and we cannot comment on something we have not received. Staub and Caffrey had been dating since April 2016 and lived together in her New Jersey home. He proposed to her on a season 8 episode  news of which PEOPLE first reported in May 2017  surprising Staub on the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where a violinist played Pachelbels Canon in D and a handful of couples danced around them. A year after Caffrey popped the question, the duo got married in May in a sunset bohemian beach ceremony held on the Bahamas North Bimini Island at the Luna Beach Club.

Danielle is having some difficulties with her marriage right now and is hoping everything will work out, Staubs rep said. Earlier this month, Caffrey obtained a temporary restraining order against Staub, just one day after Staub was granted a temporary restraining order against him following a domestic dispute at their New Jersey home over the weekend. In the court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Caffrey claimed Staub has been angry since Thursday after receiving a letter from his attorney indicating he was filing for a divorce. Both Caffrey and Staub dropped their restraining orders. Prior to the incident, the source said Caffrey and Staub were not communicating directly. Danielles been refusing to speak to him.

Its been Danielle and her daughter Jillian in one area and Marty in another. Anytime he tries to reach out to her or even walks down to the kitchen to talk to her, Danielle tells him to call her publicist. But Staubs rep fired back in a statement to PEOPLE. The claims being made are beyond preposterous and clearly a knee-jerk reaction to Danielles filing, her rep said.

He was opposed to their three children, Sophia, Sydney, and Spencer, being on the show, and it was a big part of their custody dispute. In court filings, Barney demanded no orders to pay spousal support. In 2010, he was arrested for allegedly throwing a dog leash at Tamra as they battled over who got to keep their dog. Tamra reportedly began dating Eddie Judge shortly after the papers were filed and they have since tied the knot. Simon has kept his relationships out of the public eye since divorcing Tamra. He has worked as a car and tequila salesman, and is currently the National Sales Director for Universal Dealers Consultants, a Consulting and Software company for Auto Dealers, Some their clients include Mercedes-Benz USA, BMW USA, Fletcher Jones Group, Bill Jacobs Auto Group, Soave Auto Group.

Carrey, 56, began dating makeup artist White, 30, in the summer of 2012 after they met on a film set. The Irish-born woman was found dead in a Sherman Oaks, Calif., home on Sept. 28, 2015; the Los Angeles County coroner's office later ruled White took her own life by overdosing on prescription drugs, including Ambien, Propranolol and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen). More:Jim Carrey countersues 'desperate characters' after ex's suicide The actor was a pallbearer at her funeral in Ireland. In 2016, Carrey was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit from his late girlfriend's husband, Mark Burton, her mother, Brigid Sweetman, and their lawyer, Filippo Marchino, accusing him of illegally obtaining and giving her the powerful painkillers she used to kill herself in September 2015. They also alleged that Carrey gave White three STDs without warning her. Carrey countersued, saying White had tried to extort him after the two broke up in early 2013 and that he made a \"mistake\" of settling a false STD claim with her to avoid mounting a public defense, which \"is a very costly and painful process.\" More:Jim Carrey will be 'Kidding' on new Showtime series that marks his return to TV The Hollywood Reporter says that Carrey's attorney had recently asked the court to compel Burton to provide White's STD test results. Through discovery, Boucher came to the conclusion that a 2011 document showing White had clean test results prior to meeting Carrey was a forgery. On Thursday, he told USA TODAY the underlying case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, removing the possibility of Carrey, 56, going to trial. Michael Avenatti, the attorney for Sweetman and Burton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.

Confused me how her 'squad' still hung out with Demario after the things he said against Rach,\" one follower commented on Lindsay's post. On Sunday, Jackson seemed to respond to Lindsay's tweet when he posted a photo of himself with \"Bachelorette\" co-stars Dean Unglert and Adam Gottschalk on Instagram.

Hopefully that someone will find real love in paradise next year and stop being petty on social networks. \" This comes a few weeks after Jackson accused Lindsay of discrimination during an interview.

{"message": "After Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles went public with their romance in the early 2000s, Queen Elizabeth II was not quick to bless the couple with her royal approval, having once reportedly called Bowles \"that wicked woman,\" according to British investigative journalist Tom Bower. In Bower's new biography, \"Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles,\" the journalist dives deep into the life of the second in line to the throne and his scandalous relationship with Bowles, whom he married after the death of Princess Diana. According to the book, following Diana's death, Prince Charles presented the idea of welcoming Bowles into the royal family, but the Queen was not on the same page. The Daily Mail shared an excerpt from the book in which Bower claimed the Queen called Camilla \"that wicked woman and said she wanted \"nothing to do with her\" after having \"several martinis.\" The excerpt continued on to say that the Queen was unhappy about Charles' relationship with Camilla during his marriage to Diana. \"[She] would not condone his adultery, nor forgive Camilla for not leaving Charles alone to allow his marriage to recover.\" Charles then allegedly called Bowles and delivered a \"tearful\" message. The Queen remained skeptical about the relationship for several years following Diana's 1997 passing, the book claims. It wasn't until 2005 that the Queen gave her permission to her son to marry Bowles, though Bowles had already moved into Clarence House back in 2003. The couple was not given permission to marry at the Church of England so they wed at Windsor Town Hall and were later blessed in St. George's Chapel, where Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle will tie the knot on May 19. Though the Queen eventually approved her son's marriage to Bowles, according to Bower she was still not keen on a big celebratory ceremony for their union. In his book, the journalist claims that Queen nixed any plans for a big wedding reception, ending talks about a big 650-person affair. Distraught by the smaller scale wedding plans, Charles reportedly \"wallowed in gloom.\" Since the 2005 nuptials, Bowles has reportedly slowly grown on the Queen and can now be seen standing alongside the royal family at public events and during family outings.", "title": "Queen Elizabeth called Camilla 'that wicked woman' after 'several martinis,' new book claims", "label": "real", "id": 7614, "evidence": ["Same-sex couples still won't be able to marry in the church, but they can \"come to church after a civil marriage or civil partnership to give thanks, dedicate their relationship to God and", "Zoe Shenton.

{"message": "Meghan Markle experienced a roller coaster this week as the newlywed continued to navigate her new life with Prince Harry in the British Royal Family. Recently, the Inquisitr reported that Meghan Markle took over a royal duty for Queen Elizabeth II later this year when the Queen will step back from responsibilities in the Queens Young Leaders program, and Markle will join her husband, Prince Harry in welcoming the young leaders in the program to Buckingham Palace. Earlier this week, according to an Express report, the 36-year-old Duchess of Sussex joined the Duke of Sussex and the Queen at Buckingham Palace for the Queens Young Leader Awards. Markle hit the ground running with her royal engagements after her mid-May royal wedding, and by the looks of their fun giggles at recent events, she and Queen Elizabeth II get along famously. However, the major faux pas that the new Duchess committed at the Queens Young Leader awards that made headlines was her crossing her legs over her knees instead of using the so-called Duchess Slant, which involves crossing her legs at the ankles instead of the knees. If that wasnt enough, though, now another supposed break in royal protocol has come to light. Markle attempted to reach for Prince Harrys hand as they walked behind the Queen. Meghan Markle breaks another Royal rule by trying to hold Prince Harry's hand    Daily Mail U.K. (@DailyMailUK) June 29, 2018 In a video of the event, Markle, who wore a beautiful Prada dress in pale pink with her hair softly down around her shoulders, reached out to take her new husbands hand. Instead of taking the Duchesss hand, the Duke actually pulled his arms in closer to his sides and clasped them in front of him. After the rebuff, the two continued to walk on as if nothing out of the ordinary occurred. Indeed, as a newlywed, it makes sense to reach out to hold hands when walking especially in stressful situations, but for some reason, the Royal Family does not do that very often. The Queen herself rarely holds her husband, Prince Philips, hand during official public engagements, and that seems to set the tone for the family as a whole in their interactions with the public. Although Prince Harry and Meghan Markle often hold hands, they may not be participating in official royal family engagements when they do so.

{"message": "Dior was so close to doing a great thing, but then fumbled at the last minute. For the labels Cruise 2019 collection, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri based her collection on the beautiful clothing worn by Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders. However, Chiruis inspiration fell flat when her clothing appeared on Diors face, Jennifer Lawrence. Now, both Dior and Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation. Escaramuza is a traditional Mexican sport that is comprised of 10 to 16 women on horseback doing choreographed dancing and stunts to Mexican music. The sport first began at the birth of the Mexican revolution, during which women were allowed to participate and appear at the front of the battle in their traditional dress. The wardrobe of the Escaramuza is as beautiful and precise as their routines, and an Escaramuza team must adhere to strict guidelines when crafting their uniform. Frills, shawls, ornaments, boots, and hats are all musts, and give fashion labels like Dior a lot to drool over. However, by putting Jennifer Lawrence  who is neither Mexican nor Latina  in clothing inspired by such culturally important dress for Mexican women has many questioning whether or not Dior cares about the cultural significance of the Escaramuza at all. Lawrence said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the photoshoot featured on Diors Instagram, One of the main inspirations of this collection is the traditional women riders of Mexico. Im really excited that this collection is looking at and celebrating these womens heritage through such a modern lens. Many fault Dior for lacking the wherewithal to cast a Mexican model as the face of the collection. Although Lawrence should have seen through the culturally appropriative problem, its more disappointing that Dior is just that oblivious. Dior did feature a team of Escaramuza, wearing uniforms from Chiruis collection, in the the labels Cruise 2019 fashion show. However, the models presenting the inspired clothing on the runway were primarily white. Its a bit boggling how Dior completely missed the mark. This cultural appropriation slip up is an obvious reminder that the fashion industry still has a long road ahead of them in terms of diversification and inclusion.

{"message": "'I got him a plate of prosciutto!' Animal lover Robert Pattinson reveals how his rescue dog became a pampered pooch overnight There are many reasons to be a fan of Robert Pattinson, but just in case there are people who still need swaying, he has provided another. The Twilight star showed how much of an animal lover he is during an interview on the Ellen DeGeneres which is set to air on Friday. The 26-year-old chatted about his rescue dog Bear to host Ellen  who is also a huge supporter of animal rescue. Scroll down for video Animal lover: Robert Pattinson chatted about his rescue dog Bear when he and Taylor Lautner (L) were interviewed by Ellen DeGeneres Robert revealed that he saved Bear, who was five weeks old at the time, from a kill shelter in Louisiana the day before he was about to be euthanized. And Bears life changed in an instant as he went straight from the shelter and onto a private jet to Los Angeles  which Robert revealed is not his way of usual travelling. Once he landed, Bear was tucking into some fancy meats that he was given by his doting new owner, and Robert joked that he had actually turned into a Hollywood diva dog by accident. Diva dog: The Twilight star revealed that he accidentally spoiled the dog after saving him from a kill shelter Living the dream: When he arrived at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles Bear was fed prosciutto instead of dog food He said: We were staying at the Four Seasons afterwards. He didn't have any dog food so I got him a little plate of prosciutto. R-Pattz and Taylor Lautner, who was interviewed alongside him, laughed with Ellen about Bears unusually long tongue. Ellen described the pooch as like a Gene Simmons dog and Robert added: Its like a curtain. Robert admitted he thought that adorable Bear would keep on growing, but that never happened. 'It's like a curtain': The actor joked with Ellen about the huge size of his pooch's tongue Smitten: Even Taylor admits that he is 'obsessed' with the adorable dog, who R-Pattz shares with Kristen Stewart He said: He was supposed to be a big man's dog, but he just kind of got stunted. However Bear still gets a huge amount of love and affection from Robert and Kristen Stewart, who he shares her with. Even Taylor is smitten with the pup, and confessed during the interview that he is obsessed. Meanwhile, Kristen has adopted another dog named Bernie, who is a friend to Bear. Just in time: Robert saved a then five-week-old Bear from a kill shelter just one day before he was about to be euthanized The actress said during an interview on Wednesday that she has an 'obsession with rescuing the pooches'. Robert was much more comfortable chatting about his dog with Ellen than he was during an interview on The Today Show on Wednesday, where he deflected questions about whether or not he and Kristen are back together The cast are currently promoting the final instalment of Twilight  Breaking Dawn: Part II, which hits cinemas November 16.", "title": "'I got him a plate of prosciutto!'

The 42-year-old entertainer is currently in a long and acrimonious split from her ex, Stephen Belafonte. Mel filed for divorce in March, after nearly 10 years of marriage. The following month, the singer got a restraining order against her estranged husband, alleging that Belafonte beat and threatened her throughout their nearly 10-year marriage. WATCH: Nick Cannon, Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and 'AGT' Stars Support Mel B Amid Divorce Drama Days later, Belafonte, who denied the allegations, responded when he filed a petition seeking joint custody of their 5-year-old daughter, Madison, and requesting spousal support and that Mel pay his legal fees.

The actor and ex-husband of Roseanne Barr has been on a renegade vendetta against Trump as he's been putting together a Viceland TV special called \"The Hunt for the Trump Tapes with Tom Arnold,\" not set to premiere until September 18.

{"message": "There will be no shortage of A-list celebrities attending the Oscars this weekend, but one superstar that won't be in attendance is Kate Winslet. The actress is reportedly skipping the awards show this year, and there's a pretty scandalous reason why if you choose to believe the tabloids. Star Magazine is reporting that Kate Winslet is staying away from the Oscars to avoid her Titanic costar Leonardo DiCaprio, but GossipCop is calling bullshit on that story. The tabloid claims that Winslet's husband Ned Rocknroll is feuding with DiCaprio after seeing how the actor interacted with his wife at last year's ceremony. After last year's Oscars, Star posted a gallery of images of Winslet and DiCaprio hugging and kissing at the show, and speculated that the former costars may have sparked a romance. The tabloid is claiming that Rocknroll was upset that DiCaprio barely acknowledged him last year and doesn't want to sit through another night where his wife will \"fawn over\" DiCaprio. Of course, Star is looking for drama anywhere it can find it, and the tabloid debunking site GossipCop is reporting that this rumor of a feud between Leonardo DiCaprio and Ned Rocknroll is pure fantasy. The real reason that Winslet is skipping the Oscars is much less dramatic --- the site says she actually won't be in attendance because she's currently filming her upcoming romance The Mountain Between Us with Idris Elba in Canada. A work conflict is obviously much more believable than some random feud, especially since Kate Winslet and Ned Rocknroll have been married for a good four years now. The couple met in 2011 on the British Virgin Islands, which are owned by Rocknroll's billionaire uncle Richard Branson. They got engaged and married a year later, and in 2013 had their son Bear Blaze Winslet. Both Winslet and Rocknroll had been married before --- Winslet twice, to directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes, and Rocknroll once, to heiress Eliza Pearson --- and Winslet has two children from her previous marriages. If you're wondering what's up with Ned Rocknroll's last name (like I was), it was apparently just a result of him wanting to take life less seriously. The 38-year-old businessman was born with the much less eye-catching last name of Smith, but decided to legally change it to Rocknroll as a reaction against people taking things so seriously, according to the Daily Mail. And if Ned Rocknroll hates seriousness enough to legally change his name, it sure leads me to believe that he wouldn't get too wrapped up in a petty celebrity feud.

The 47-year-old actress, who tied the knot to the Bond actor in 2011, confessed that it was never an ambition of hers to marry until she met Daniel Craig, in a new interview with ES Magazine. The Oscar-winning star revealed she was very independent in her youth and had even struggled to watch chick flicks, before love just happened one day with the actor, 49. Rachel Weisz says marriage isnt particularly exceptional (Picture: PA) Speaking of their relationship, she said: Its very personal, its very private. I dont think mines particularly exceptional apart from that were both in the public eye. But I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite. The Brit added: I couldnt relate to romantic comedies  marriage seems to be the whole point of them. Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment. The pair, who are notoriously private about their romance, had been pals years before they worked as an on-screen couple on psychological thriller Dream House in 2010. They began dating the same year and went on to tie the knot in New York in 2011. Rachel Weisz: My marriage to Daniel Craig isnt particularly exceptional (Picture: Evening Standard Magazine) She also touched on the sexual misconduct scandal that has been shaking up Hollywood as she spoke of her friend Sophie Dix, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. My friend Sophie Dix has been talking about this since the 1990s, she said. She would tell anyone who would listen to her story, for the last 20 years. And no-one seemed to care. When asked why it took two decades for the media to pick up on the allegations against Weinstein, she said of the movie mogul, who denies non-consensual sex: I think his power was on the wane Its about economics, (not) turning over the big bucks any more. Thats not an optimistic thing to say, but this is all about power and money. The full interview appears in this weeks issue of ES Magazine, available on 25 January. Got a showbiz story?

{"message": "A new report claims that Gwen Stefani has called off her wedding to Blake Shelton after months of planning the June ceremony. The mother-of-three began to panic about Sheltons possible infidelity, and it resulted in a huge fight, with Stefani ultimately deciding the two shouldnt tie the knot. Could there be any truth to the story? Life  and  Style is claiming that Stefani was not happy with how close Shelton had become with Chloe Kohanski, his 24-year-old team member on The Voice. Their student-teacher relationship unnerved the No Doubt singer, and after Kohanski won the show, Stefani decided to confront Shelton  and thats when the fight and wedding cancellation happened. It makes sense that Stefani would be insecure about cheating since her 13-year marriage to Gavin Rossdale ended when he had an affair with their nanny. It seems unlikely that Shelton would cheat, but just the thoughts of infidelity are enough for Stefani to call off their planned nuptials. Sources claim the couple is still together and they will get married someday, but right now the couple is working on their issues. The last thing either of them wants is another divorce. Stefani and Shelton met on the set of the NBC reality singing competition and began dating in 2015 after Stefani divorced Rossdale and Shelton ended his marriage to Miranda Lambert. But, could any of this actually be true? Or, is it just another false story from a tabloid? According to Gossip Cop, its the latter. The rumor-busting website says that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski, and Stefanis rep told them that reports of a wedding being called off are simply untrue.

{"message": "As Billy Bush sat across from Stephen Colbert on Mondays Late Show, the audiences reaction was muted; after a few seconds, their applause could barely be heard. Its understandable: Bush has been a divisive figure at best since that infamous Access Hollywood tape, on which Donald Trump boasted about groping women while Bush laughed along. On Sunday, Bush published a New York Times op-ed about the tape, emphasizing its veracityand saying that he believes the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, women the White House has broadly branded as liars. Since then, a debate has raged regarding whether Bush should have a second chance in the public eye. His Late Show audience, at least, didnt seem fully on board with Bushs apology tour, remaining largely somber during his appearanceeven as Bush once more affirmed the truth of the tape, despite Trump recently suggesting the opposite. I would also like to say thats not me on the bus, Bush joked to Colbert, before addressing Trump: You dont get to say that, because I was there, and the last 14 months of my life I have been dealing with it. You dealt with it for 14 minutes and went on to be the president. As powerful men across several industries continue to face allegations of sexual abuse, the idea of a Bush redemption tour might seem unnecessary and, perhaps, even counter-productive. No, Bushs actions were not criminal; he did not sexually harass or mistreat any women himself. But his laughter on the tape represents, to some, the very culture of abuse that allowed Trump to ascend to the presidency. Why should he be welcomed back to the spotlight?

There were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary.

The webloid claimed that Fergie finds Kendall really attractive and is keen on getting close to her. Fergie thinks Kendalls so hot and she wants to get close. Apparently, Kendall and Fergie first met behind the scenes of a fashion show. The mother-of-one allegedly thinks that she had an instant connection with the Victorias Secret model. The gossip site also noted that the Big Girls Dont Cry singer has already worked with the supermodel. Just recently, Kendall appeared in Fergies new music video for Enchant (Carine).

I was threatened to be fired. I told them, You cant fire a boss. I quit! At the time, Cannons choosing to walk away from a reported $4.5 million paycheck shocked his fans, and even people in his camp thought Cannon was making a mistake.

{"message": "Beyonce set fans tongues wagging all over again about a possible 4th baby when she stepped out in France in a long, stomach-covering gown with Blue Ivy and Jay-Z. See the very suspicious pics here! If Beyonces not pregnant, she certainly isnt helping squash the baby rumors! Queen Bey stepped out in Cannes with husband Jay-Z wearing a flowy maxi dress with an empire waist. You know what that means  it didnt show an inch of her figure, even her arms. Well, almost everything was covered. The dress was cut totally low and showed off a massive amount of cleavage. She was wearing a pair of sky-high, stripped wedges, which feels like the opposite of what a pregnant woman would wear! However, this is Beyonce were talking about; shes the star who performed in a floating chair at the Grammys while extremely pregnant with twins! SEE PICS OF BEYONCE HIDING HER STOMACH IN A FLOWY DRESS HERE. Pregnancy rumors started when it appeared that Bey gave the audience a sly signal that she was expecting during an On The Run II tour stop in Rome on July 8. In fan footage from the concert, she can be seen briefly rubbing her stomach. Seem familiar? Thats how she gleefully revealed that she was pregnant with daughter Blue Ivy at the 2011 VMAs! She got pretty extra with her second pregnancy announcement, rolling out a full earth mother photoshoot to welcome twins Sir and Rumi in 2017, but maybe shes going low key again! Not to mention, Beyonce was also recently spotted walking around Europe with a large purse strategically covering her stomach. Slick! You know how much the Carters love the number four, right? Beyonce was born on September 4 while Jay-Z was born on December 4. They got married on April 4, 2008. Beyonce released an album called 4 in 2011, and Jay-Z released 4:44 in 2017! It only makes sense that they welcome a fourth child into the world, too! At the end of June, Beyonce wore a skintight outfit in concert that showcased a totally flat tummy.

Like many celebrities before her, Taylor recognized that it was possible to be too famous. But unlike many of them, she took action to fix it, and then actually kept her word. Fourth of July came and went without her annual Rhode Island celebration, known colloquially as Taymerica. The only photos of the star released publicly since the February concert have been taken with new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and theyre grainy, as if taken with an incredibly long lens. (Unlike, say, the remarkably sharp paparazzi photos that first introduced Taylor and Tom Hiddleston to the world.) Theres the one on a Nashville balcony and the one supposedly boarding her jet in the U.K. The only social media weve seen from her is in service of her friends music releasesone Instagram for each, Selena Gomez, the sisters Haim, and Lorde, plus a small video shout-out to Russell Westbrook, this past N.B.A. seasons M.V.P., and a word of support tweeted after the Manchester bombing. So enamored were we with the idea that Swift has been acing the laying low directive that when a Splash News paparazzi claimed the singer was carried out of her Tribeca apartment in a big box, it didnt feel completely beyond the realm of possibility (the photo service since retracted the claim). And now, for further proof that Taylor Swift is still committed to giving the world a breather from Taylor Swift, compare what going to the gym in 2016 looks like to what going to the gym in 2017 looks like: From left, by Raymond Hall/GC Images, by NCP/Star Max/GC Images, by Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto, from Backgrid. Swift is known for her creative paparazzi-avoidance tactics, like walking backward so they cant train their lens on her face.

Currently in its 18th week of release, it's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's  being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies. All of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies. However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined. 2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales. Swifts 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May.

However, an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY Angie also doesnt want to see him with someone new. Even though [Angelina Jolie] wanted the split, shes terrified Brad [Pitt] will move on and find love with someone new, an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Its one of those she cant live with him, and she cant live without him, things. Brad and Angie had scorching chemistry and she just cant handle seeing him with another woman. She definitely gets very jealous. Oh, we are totally aware of the kind of chemistry that Brad, 53, and Angelina, 41, had when they were still together. Their 10-year romance was fiery from the very beginning  back when they were filming Mr.  and  Mrs. Smith while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, 48. The kind of passion they had on screen had fans wondering if they had a thing for each other. Those suspicions were confirmed when Brad left Jen for Angie and they embarked on a new life together in which they would have several children (both adopted and biological) and eventually get married. But Angie decided to end that marriage in September 2016 and the two have since been stuck in the middle of a complex divorce and custody battle. With everything that is going on we can see why Angie has complicated feelings when it comes to Brad dating again. Shes definitely keeps an eye on him and what hes up to, the source added. Besides just not wanting to see him with someone else, Angie really doesnt want to see another woman come into the kids lives. That would really freak her out. For now she doesnt really have much to worry about, as Brad is focused on the kids, his health, art and his career, the insider said. Other than that he just doesnt have interest in another relationship. Well, at least we know that she has some time to get used to the idea before he starts bringing women home to meet the kids!

That is not a typo. And, no, we did not mean to write Kristen Stewart all you Twilight superfans. Rob and his new cutie chanteuse, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, have been quietly dating for about a month, according to a report, with Rob doing what he does best and flying under the radar with this major coupling news. The biggest sighting of the two together was walking around NYC and even then they were sure to keep a distance from one another. Rob is a pro. As everyone in the whole entire world knows, Rob was previously one half of Robsten with Miss Stewart, reigning as one of, if not the, most photographed and written about celebrity couples in the world for a few years, much to their mutual and very visible displeasure. The two were the romantic leads in a giant movie franchise, traveling the world together and walking red carpets nonstop for roughly four years. They even got a dog. Then, Kristen landed the role of Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman, directed by Rupert Sanders  And we all know how that turned out! Lucky for Rob, his new gal pal also seems to shun the spotlight. Hes been taking her on dates for the last month or so, and has even flown her out to stay with him in New York. He also loves going to her gigs, a source told UK newspaper The Sun. The main thing for Tahliah is that the relationship remains low key.

She has always been a very serious, and very good, actress, highly in demand since her breakthrough role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster almost 20 years ago.

The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, Its all in Gods hands always, along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, That was aimed directly at Alex. Hollywoods hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning hes still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months  including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and thats what made Jennifer lose it, the insider tells In Touch. Of course, he said it wasnt physical, and maybe it wasnt, but in Jennifers book, thats still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alexs actions have jeopardized everything. The damage runs deep. Jennifer, whos endured three failed marriages, was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren, says the insider.

But theres one decision Justin just cant support. Jessica wants to wait to have more children, an insider exclusively tells In Touch, while Justin desperately wants another baby right now. Before their 2012 wedding, Jessica promised the singer theyd have a big family, the insider says. Then she had their son, Silas, 2, and now the 7th Heaven alum isnt sure about baby No. 2.

While we thought that was the case with Gavin Rossdale, he ended up breaking her heart and cheating on her after 14 years of marriage and three beautiful children later. But in 2015, Stefani met Blake Shelton while filming The Voice, and the two have been dating ever since. Hes getting along well with her children and seems to treat her well. A post shared by ExtraTV (@extratv) on Jul 30, 2018 at 9:00am PDT Even though theyve both said they arent rushing into marriage (since they each divorced their spouses not too long ago), are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton secretly married? According to sources, the couple has been trying to conceive a child of their own. Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold. Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But theyve decided to not focus on it for the time being. Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys. Blake has always wanted children. And hes great with Gwens kids, which prompted them wanting their own, an insider said. A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jun 28, 2018 at 4:35pm PDT It looks like they are putting their plans to have children on hold  so does that mean they want to get married beforehand? Because Stefani is so traditional, getting pregnant without being married is unlikely. If thats the case, did they have a quickie wedding to move things along? Back in April, she confirmed to Ellen Degeneres she is not married. Degeneres asked her questions about Shelton, to which Stefani replied, It's weird because I get nervous when you talk to me about him. I don't know why, but for some reason, the cameras are rolling and I shouldn't say something. So if I say, 'We are [getting married],' then we are, and if I say, 'No, we're not,' then that would be sad, too. The good news, however, is that her children are taken with him. We love him, Stefani commented. Everybody loves him. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time. Even Shelton himself thinks about marrying Stefani. In an interview with CMTs Cody Alan, Shelton admitted, I think about it. I dont think its anytime soon or anything. The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer youd be getting to that. As for a secret marriage, you can put the rumors to rest. This couple is taking things slow, but we may see Stefani walking down the aisle again in the near future.

Anyway, according to Entertainment Tonight, Brad has been dating women not in the public eye as he tried to keep his private life just that. A source explained to the website: Hes very private about who hes seeing, but he does continue to casually date.

When they first split he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, hes been going out more, they said. He enjoys going out to eat with close friends. Sounds like a blast.

{"message": "Multiple tabloids have been reporting that there is something going on between Robert Pattinson and Emma Watson, leading fans to believe that there could be some merit to the story. Then, after the pair presented together at the Golden Globe Awards, reports surfaced that the two went public with their relationship. But, fans will be disappointed to find out that there is no truth to the story, and the claims that Pattinson and Watson are dating are completely false. The problem is, celebrities dont choose who they present with at an awards show. So, the fact that Pattinson and Watson shared a few minutes on stage together in no way means the two are in a relationship. The pair presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBOs Big Little Lies.

The so-called eyewitness then says that, since Watson isnt a one-night stand type of girl, she made a face like she had eaten some rotten food and ran away. But, the incident simply never happened. Reps for both Watson and Pattinson say that the two actors had fun at the awards ceremony, but he didnt hit on her and she didnt reject him.

The Enquirers source claimed at the beginning of 2017, Rachel and Daniel havent been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year. The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in 554 days. According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couples rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New Yorks Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I dont buy it for a minute. When you consider Daniel Craigs own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I dont trust myself. I need that balance.

Katie, 39, did not wipe the smile off her face as she frolicked and cuddled the Oscar-winning actor in front of fellow beachgoers. Proving to be quite the playful couple, Jamie, 50, at one point is seen scooping the Kennedys actress into his arms and bending her over his arms before collapsing onto the floor. While Jamie is usually the life and soul of the party, Katie took the chance to entertain the comedian by doing cartwheels across the sand and pulling gymnastic poses. Get a beach, guys (PPLOS/ The Mega Agency) After battling each other at a game of volleyball, the smitten couple were then pictured laying on a blanket and kissing, marking a rare moment of affection for the notoriously private couple. The lovebirds later watched the stunning ocean view while sipping cups of champagne which they brought along with their picnic. Date goals! Katie and Jamie are believed to have been dating for five years but photos of them together have only emerged in the past year. Perhaps their most high-profile outing to date, the couple sat together at Clive Davis Pre-Grammys Awards Gala in February and were the picture of romantic bliss. It is alleged that Katie was keen to keep their romance under wraps following her widely-publicised divorce from ex-husband Tom Cruise in 2012. No doubt Katie and Jamie relished in some alone time given their busy family life and work schedules. Katie is mother to 11-year-old daughter Suri, whom she shares with Tom, while Jamie is a father to daughters Corinne, 24, and nine-year-old Annalise, from previous relationships. The happy date photos appear to shoot down recent reports that Katie and Jamie had split. A recent report by Radar Online claimed the relationship had ended due to trust issues. Although they have never confirmed their romance, a rep for Katie told People that the reports of a break-up 100 percent untrue. Got a showbiz story?

Not surprisingly, the photo gained a ton of traffic with over 121,000 likes. A few days later, the mother of two shared yet another photo in a skimpy string bikini on the same trip, according to the Inquisitr. The photo trifecta was complete with the last picture, one of Johnson and Simpson, both in their swimsuits. However, even after posting a ton of body positive images, an NW tabloid cover claims that Simpson feels fat and alone while they also shared a less than flattering bikini picture from Jessicas vacation. But Gossip Cop reports that the tabloid cover couldnt be any further from the truth and neither could the accompanying article, which claims Simpson gained over 50 lbs and is down in the dumps because of her weight gain. The article also claims that Simpson feels as though she has hit a low point at her acting and singing careers and since her professional life no longer puts her on the stage, she doesnt have motivation to work out. But the publication fails to mention the fact that the 37-year-old is head of a billion dollar fashion brand and appears to be doing just fine career wise.

Supposedly, Ben wasnt ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, hes begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest. Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back. Despite two years of trying to fix things  Jennifer put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the childrens sake, as well as theirs, a fiend told Us  it was all in vain.

Things looked positivethey both wanted it to work. Though some observers thought it was like they were together again, it just wasnt meant to be, and the couple went ahead with the divorce filing. Despite this report, people shouldnt get too excited for a happy reunion. There is no truth here, a source close to the exes EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com about this report. Though the source denied Bens begging, the insiders said that Ben and Jennifer have much love and admiration for each other. Even Us Weeklys report claims that Bens cries were falling on deaf ears. She forgave him for such much and still he couldnt change, a source tells Us. She feels its important to keep the peace and be a family unit, but when it comes to romance, shes not going there at all. She and Ben will still spend time together, but it will be only for the benefit of their children. She just wants her kids to heave a healthy, happy and engaged father  and shell do whatever it takes to make that happen. [ While Ben has moved on to Lindsey, what about Jen? Shes reportedly been on a few dates  one with an Affleck look-alike. Jennifer is ready to go with her feelings and give love another try.

{"message": "Dan Fogelman Image Credit: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman was getting ready  brushing his teeth while listening to the nominations on his wife's cell phone  as he prepared to head back to work on episode two of the NBC drama's sophomore season when he learned of his show's multiple mentions. The time-jumping family drama scored 11 total nominations  including best drama series, the first time a broadcast series has cracked the category since 2011. \"The emails are flying!\" Fogelman told THR early Thursday. \"We're so busy right now that there's not a lot of time to think  the feed was freezing and we didn't quite understand what was happening. People were texting us ahead of us understanding what was going on!\" Fogelman noted that the way This Is Us is filmed  with members of the family working together in different scenes at any given time and not a lot of group scenes  will make getting the whole group together to celebrate complicated. \"There hasn't been a lot of planning! I need to figure out how to get everyone together in some way  I've never done this before!\" the first-time nominee enthused. The busy producer was on his way to film on location Thursday and planned to find a way to head to the show's L.A. set to celebrate properly with the production. One thing that wasn't lost on Fogelman: how challenging it is for programming that is both sentimental and heartfelt to cut through a cluttered landscape filled with dark dramas and anti-heroes. \"Normally if you have a sentiment in your show it's not in the same conversation as darker fare, and if you have sentiment and comedy? That's even more dangerous,\" he said, crediting stars including fellow nominees Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown and Chrissy Metz, among others, for helping to elevate the content with serious performances. \"You actually feel like you're watching something more weighty than it may be because the actors are so good. That's why our show was able to cut through multiple conversations: it's popular and critical.\" As for what to expect when the 18-episode second season returns in the fall, Fogelman and company plan to lean deeper into the family's drama. \"The family has big stories this season. The first season laid out the logistics of the family and in the second season, we're able to dig deeper. We're doing heavy duty stuff to understand the separation between Chrissy and Mandy Moore's mother and daughter and why they feel so distant from each other.

Of course, he said it wasnt physical, and maybe it wasnt, but in Jennifers book, thats still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alexs actions have jeopardized everything. The damage runs deep. Jennifer, whos endured three failed marriages, was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren, says the insider. Even though they didnt meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alexs antics. She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami, she claimed. He never even mentioned her. Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer would be an idiot to believe hed be faithful, she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. I dont think hes sexually attracted to her, she dished. In bed hes probably picturing me. Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, shes not sure what to believe. Jennifers still on the fence, says the insider. She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it.

{"message": "Melanie Mel B Brown and husband Stephen Belafonte seem to have settled some of the issues in their contentious divorce ahead of their trial, set to begin Nov. 13. The couple, who are ending their marriage after 10 years wed, reached an agreement in the domestic violence portion of their divorce, TMZ reports  with the former Spice Girl agreeing to drop the temporary restraining order she filed in April against Belafonte. Brown, 42, had accused her ex of physically and emotionally abusing her, alleging in her TRO filing that she was in fear for her life and that Belafontes alleged abuse ramped up when her career was on an upswing. Belafonte, 42, and Brown  who wed in Las Vegas in June 2007  also settled a portion of their property division, TMZ reports. A rep for Brown did not immediately return PEOPLEs request for comment. Phillip Faraone/Getty The former couples divorce has been a nasty battle since Brown filed in March and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Brown also requested to terminate the courts ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafontes behalf.) Amid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nannys relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion. She was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved. RELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel Bs Restraining Order Against Her Ex Meanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafontes marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout much to most of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets. Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage, Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Browns allegations, claiming they are nothing more than a smear campaign. Also in court in October, Browns lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were of a sexual nature, according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Browns legal team, said 90 percent of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Browns consent. Belafontes lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were consensual.

Back in December, lawyers for Kim, Kourtney and Khlo Kardashian opposed the request for the 28-year-old reality star (ne Angela Rene White) to trademark what her presumed married name would be if she went ahead with her then-engagement to their brother, Rob Kardashian. According to the documents filed in December, the sisters lawyers claimed theyll suffer damage including irreparable injury to their reputation and goodwill if Chyna takes the Kardashian name. The documents also said that Robs on-again, off-again girlfriend  and mother of his 4-month-old daughter Dream Rene  is deliberately seeking to profit from the goodwill and popularity by changing her name. However, a source close to Chyna previously told PEOPLE, Shes not trying to do anything negative. She wants to trademark the name because it will be her name when she gets married and she wants to protect it. Its also her daughters last name and she wants to share a last name with her daughter. FROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time Chynas lawyer Walter Mosley told PEOPLE in December that of the many trademarks hes filed for her, this is the first one thats ever been opposed. The Kardashians, like Angela and my other clients, are very protective of our marks, I think for us this is going to be a clear case win, because its actually her name, its not a poaching, he said. Im hoping that its just a big misunderstanding but Im just proceeding as if its not and am going to do the best work I can for my client, Mosley added. RELATED VIDEO: Are Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian Back Together? Larry Zerner, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer specializing in trademark litigation, told PEOPLE at the time of the filing that even if Chyna does marry into the Kardashian family, her legal name may be blocked from being trademarked. A lot of name trademarks are worth a lot of money. For example, Martha Stewart is trademarked and Calvin Klein  those are all names of people, thats the brand, he said. The purpose of the trademark is to tell the consumer that the source of the goods is what it is. He continued, To go back to my Martha Stewart analogy, if someone wanted to register Martha Stewart they would probably get opposed. If someone wants to register Angela Stewart that might be okay.

{"message": "Is the bad blood between Taylor Swift and Katy Perry coming to an end? While fans expect Tay to throw some shade towards her rival with her new album, Reputation will reportedly have no anti-Katy disses at all! Is this it? Could the longstanding war between Taylor Swift, 27, and Katy Perry, 32, finally be over? It seems that Taylor is ready to move on, as her upcoming album, Reputation, has absolutely no anti-Katy tracks, according to TMZ. Taylors new record is devoid of hate or trash talking directed at [Katy], a source tells the publication. Huh. It may be too soon to call Reputation a peace treaty, but if Taylor has refrained from dissing Katy, her sixth album could signal a cease-fire between these warring divas. Wait, what about that Mean Girls reference on Look What You Made Me Do? Taylors brand new single seems to take a subtle dig at Katy, as Ms. Swift sings Ive got a list of names/ and yours is in red underlined. Some fans have compared that line to the movie where Regina Georges picture is in the burn book, with her name underlined in red ink. Katy, back in 2014, warned fans to watch out for the Regina George in sheeps clothing. Plus, another Internet Nancy Drew said that the song sounds similar to Peachess song Operate, which was featured in the movie. Surely, this means something, right? Well, it may be pure coincidence, as a source tells TMZ that Taylors album lyrics have nothing to do with Mean Girls, Regina George or Katy. Interesting. With the video for LWYMMD dropping during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards  an event that Katy is hosting, by the way  fans will see if Taylor has truly decided to give Katy a pass on her new album. If that wasnt enough, sources tell TMZ that something big will happen at the VMAs between Katy and Taylor, and that it would not be surprising if the two appeared on stage together to publicly bury the hatchet.

While Look What You Made Me Do may not be Taylors response to Katys Swish, Swish, many fans have taken it as a shot at Kanye West, 40, and Kim Kardashian, 36. After all, it was Taylors drama over Kanyes Famous that had fans rebranding her as Queen of the Snakes, and many have interpreted the lyrics of the song to be a Kanye-diss. However, Kim isnt really sweating Taylor, as a source close to Kimye EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLiife.com that Taylors track isnt really bothering Kim. On the other hand, Kanye is clearly pissed over the song, the source said. Uh-oh. One feud may have ended, but another is still going strong.

With a career that spans decades and ranges from the scandalous to the transcendent, she is a bigger phenomenon than ever. But who is the private woman behind the public image? Andrew Morton, whose #1 New York Times bestsellers about Princess Diana and Monica Lewinsky have proven his ability to gain access to insiders who won't talk to anyone else, answers that question in this decidedly unauthorized new biography. Morton's extensive, in-depth interviews with members of Madonna's inner circle-- lovers, friends, and business connection, many of whom have never spoken out before-- allow him to go beyond the carefully constructed myths to unmask the real Madonna. Andrew Morton is able to make startling revelations, among them the real story of Madonna's family background; the events behind the violent attack that changed her views on sex and men; her relationships with Michael Jackson, Prince, John F. Kennedy Jr., Vanilla Ice, and other rock and Hollywood stars; the mystery man she wanted to marry; and the darkest days of her career when she threatened to quit show business.

And then some very dedicated fans unearthed a couple blurry photos that appear to show her with a baby bumpdated from all the way back to September? Now twitterers are saying that, based on the size of her supposed bump in those photos from three months ago (which, BTW, is in no way \"proof\" of anything), the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister must have had her baby by now.

There have been rumors going around that Prince Charles isnt Prince Harrys real dad, so many fans are wondering if Harry and James Hewitt are actually father and son since they look alike.

In a previous interview with Australias Sunday Night, James was asked, Are you Harrys father? from the shows host. No, Im not, the 60-year-old candidly admitted. He was then asked why he thought the truth of Harrys paternity has been in constant doubt over the years. It sells papers. Its worse for [Harry], probably, poor chap, James shared. James in 2004. James and Diana previously met in 1986, two years after Harry was born (Diana welcomed Harry with Charles in September 1984). The two were introduced around the same time Charles was rumored to be having an affair with his now-wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. However, James claims prove that Charles is actually Harrys father (Phew!). James reflected on his and Dianas whirlwind and private romance. Its a gradual period and then, you know, suddenly you cant get enough of each other or see each other as much as you want, he said, adding they had some great, low-key times together.

{"message": "Jennifer Lawrence said a peculiar thing the other day while talking about Joy, her new film for the notably \"difficult\" director David O. Russell. \"David respects me so much that he will literally forget what sex I am,\" she said with a laugh. \"He sometimes refers to me as a 'he' without realising it.\" For anyone interested in gender identity, there is a can of worms right there: even for the charmingly feisty Lawrence, apparently, real acceptance means being counted as one of the boys. At the same time, Lawrence's honorary gender neutrality invites some reflections on the working partnerships between directors and actors, which can last through several films or even entire careers. This does not, necessarily, mean becoming one of the boys. Some actors  traditionally women  are recognised as muses, inspiring the male directors who construct scenarios around them and explore their faces with the camera. Many muses have become partners or wives: Ingrid Bergman with Roberto Rossellini, Anna Karina and Jean-Luc Godard and Gena Rowlands with John Cassavetes spring to mind, but the list is a long one. Indeed, the muse model is so pervasive that it has become one of the defining ways we read films. Years ago, I interviewed the French director Leos Carax about the film Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, which starred his then lover Juliette Binoche. As a student, he readily admitted, he would go to the tiny cinemas on the Left Bank to screenings of old movies by Fellini (whose wife Giulietta Masina was his favoured leading lady) or Antonioni (Monica Vitti) and dream of someday directing a film and having a beautiful girlfriend: for him, the work and the woman were so intertwined as to be synonymous. He had then been with Binoche for three years; I wasn't to know they were going through the throes of splitting up. What was it like to work with someone he knew so well? \"I do not think,\" he spat, \"that I know her well at all.\" Such is the ambivalence of the artist-muse relationship: it can be scratchy, even explosive. But even in a relationship as clearly collaborative as that between German director Christian Petzold and the actor Nina Hoss, who have made six films together as platonic friends, there still is a gap of understanding. Hoss believes that difference is a source of strength. \"Even though we are friends, I always have the feeling that Christian thinks he doesn't quite understand me  and I like that,\" she told me in the course of discussing their new film Phoenix. \"I think the ideas he puts into his characters have a lot to do with him, which may be why he always chooses women.

Oct 20, 2017 AceShowbiz - Katy Perry seemingly doesn't want to get reminded of her enemy Taylor Swift any where and any time, including on \"American Idol\" revival. Now that she serves as one of the judges on the ABC show, the \"Swish Swish\" singer reportedly bans the contestants from singing any of Taylor's song. However, a source explains to Naughty Gossip that it's not because she hates the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer, but because Katy wants to keep the spotlight on the show and the contestants. \"Katy wants the show to be about finding new talent not the ongoing drama between her and Taylor,\" reveals the source. The source continues saying, \"If someone auditioning sings a Taylor song then the whole thing becomes about Katy's reaction, not the person auditioning.\" Katy reportedly \"is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'.\" In addition, \"she's not exactly upset that people will be singing her hits and not Taylor's.\" On the revived show, Katy will be joined by fellow coaches Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan.

Damon has publicly supported Democrats, including Mr Trumps rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton. The reports first emerged on Thursday and claimed Damon was moving to Australia along with his four daughters and wife, Luciana Barroso. Damon has previously shown his lack of support for the President. In January last year, during a panel in Davos, he said America was heading into new territory with the President. Meanwhile, during the 2016 US presidential elections Damon expressed he was nervous about the prospect of a Trump presidency. Theres no way we can let this guy be the [president].

Theyre not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail, the insider tells the magazine. The reason they have held off until this point isnt a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellens money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portias $20 million fortune).

But its unlikely that thatll happen  as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, [Ellens] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has.

Find out exact dates here  and  why she hopes baby comes that week! Khloe Kardashian, 33, is reportedly expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, 26, and shes rumored to be about five months along in her pregnancy, putting her due date somewhere in February. More specifically though, shes apparently due in MID February, and shes hoping her babys birthdate falls during NBA All-Star Weekend. Why? Because that way, Tristan, who plays basketball for the Cleveland Cavaliers, doesnt have to miss out on any court time. Click here to see adorable pics of Khloe with her nieces and nephews. But while Tristan will have a nice chunk of time off during All-Star Weekend, hes also made sure hell be able to take a short break when baby Thompson arrives  no matter WHEN it happens. Tristan will be given a few days off from the Cavs when Khloe goes into labor, and everyone is actually hoping it occurs during the NBA All-Star break so he doesnt miss any time on the court, a source close to the Cavs revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. But one thing that is good, is that the All-Star Game is actually in LA this season. So things may work out perfectly, at least that is what everyone is hoping for. But regardless, he has already got it covered if the baby comes before or after. NBA All-Star Weekend will be held from February 16th-19th next year, and, conveniently, itll take place in LA at the Staples Center.

The Cavs last game before All-Star Weekend is an away game on Feb. 13, and their first game once All-Star Weekend has ended is a home game on Feb. 22. So it looks like Khloes due date falls in between the the 16th and the 19th, but anytime in February is also fair game. In preparation of their tiny addition, Tristan, who resides on the East Coast, is looking to buy a home in LA, according to TMZ. While the athlete was previously after a temporary home in LA, since Khloes pregnancy news, he wants something much more permanent in order to be close to Khloe and their future child, the media outlet reported. Tristan is reportedly set on Bel Air, Beverly Hills, or the Hollywood Hills, and has a budget of around $20 million.

The former Baywatch star can no longer afford the $21,000-per-month alimony payments to ex-wife Pamela Bach as he claims less than $4,000 to his name, according to TMZ.

Bach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bachs payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isnt sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments. Hasselhoffs European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and hes reportedly unsure if his new reality show, Hoff the Record, will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors. While the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoffs assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up. Though Bachs team alleges that Hasselhoffs net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.

Could these skeletons in Seacrests closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?

At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasnt the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims. This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.

She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out. Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accusers head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes. But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears. Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations.

Photo / Getty Images Always cutting a svelte figure on the red carpet, actress Nicole Kidman is said to be a fan of this diet. Photo / Getty Images The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits. The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm. Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works. \"The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,\" Lee said. Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images \"As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.\" Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning. \"By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,\" Lee said. \"New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.\" Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy. \"But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,\" Lee said.

{"message": "Ever since Donald Trump, a former reality television star, was elected the President of the United States, weve regularly wondered if other celebrities are going to run for the same position in the 2020 election. In the last few months, weve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane The Rock Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run  and thats just naming a few. Theres also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president? The topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if hed like to run for president one day, and Clooney said, \"Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.\" Nothing but respect for my President and George Clooney.    J. (@JojoCule) February 20, 2018 Now, Clooneys latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the March for Our Lives, its taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and its a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform. George Clooney will March For Our Lives ... pic.twitter.com/HlA8U2K4xW  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 20, 2018 Shortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit. Fox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, My attitude is, Run, George, run. If George Clooney wants to run, Im all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney. Hannitys comments are sarcastic. What hes trying to say is that he doesnt think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run  so that Trump could win again. George Clooney for President. I'm not a fan in general, but he does more for this country then all the Trumps and their administration put together.  U.S. Blues  (@starshine731) February 20, 2018 Is there a chance Clooney might actually make a move? Most likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesnt think celebrities should hold the position. He stated, \" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe well find someone who knows how to make policy.\" So, we probably wont be calling him President George Clooney any time soon.

According to Radar, the former Today show host is friendless after his old Long Island pals disowned once news of his allegations and subsequent firing broke. Famous pals like rock icon Billy Joel and radio host Howard Stern are cutting all ties to the disgraced anchor. These guys dont exactly have the best track records in their own married lives, and they also have their careers to protect, a source tells Radar.

{"message": "Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she \"would look for a senatorial run\" Other celebrities have recently floated political runs Washington CNN  Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump. The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the the political side of activism and would look for a senatorial run. Can I do a better job from the outside? said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run. When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are no further details to report at this time. This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.

Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 general election, but has also expressed disappointment is some of the Trump administrations policies.
